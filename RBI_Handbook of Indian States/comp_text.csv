IMF Executive Board Concludes 2019 Article IV Consultation with India 
On November 25, 2019, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded  the Article IV consultation1with India. The staff report and the macroeconomic projections are based  on data available through October 16, 2019. 
India has been among the fastest-growing economies in the world over the past few years, lifting  millions out of poverty. However, growth slowed to 5.0 percent in the April-June 2019 quarter (y/y),  a six-year low. The deceleration of consumption and investment was exacerbated by weaknesses in  the non-bank financial sector and corporate and environmental regulatory uncertainty. Weak demand  in conjunction with continued low food prices—thanks to successive normal monsoon rainfall and  agricultural sector reforms—caused average inflation to moderate to a multi-year low of 3.4 percent  in FY2018/19. Through August, inflation remained below the mid-point of the Reserve Bank of India  (RBI)’s medium-term inflation target band of 4 percent ± 2 percent. 
After rising through late 2018, external vulnerabilities eased in the first three quarters of 2019, on  lower oil prices and renewed portfolio inflows. In FY2018/19, the current account deficit (CAD)  widened to 2.1 percent of GDP, on a rising oil import bill. Foreign direct investment (FDI) financed  about half of the CAD. The rupee depreciated by about 3.4 and 5.9 percent on average in real and  nominal effective terms in FY2018/19, also reflecting portfolio outflows in mid-2018. The U.S. dollar  value of non-oil merchandise exports expanded by 6.6 percent, broadly maintaining India’s global  export market share. Gross reserves declined by US$12 billion during FY2018/19 to US$413 billion  (7 months of imports), while the net forward position fell by US$34 billion. Gross reserves rose to  US$429 billion by end-August 2019 on renewed portfolio inflows and they remain adequate. India’s  external debt remains low at 19 percent of GDP.  
Macro-financial risks from banking sector weaknesses have decreased somewhat, and steps have been  taken to enhance monitoring of NBFCs and alleviate liquidity pressures faced by some NBFCs.  Capital injections from the government budget and the initial results of the implementation of the  Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) have improved public sector banks (PSBs) capital position  and asset quality. The plan to merge several PSBs reduces their number to 12 but does not change the  
1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,  usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses  with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a  report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. 
large presence of the government in the banking system. The growth of bank credit decelerated to 10  percent (y/y) in August 2019, from 14 percent (y/y) in December 2018. 
Despite a shortfall in revenues relative to ambitious targets, the central government broadly adhered  to its headline fiscal deficit objective. As a result, there was a small improvement in the on-budget  fiscal balance in FY2018/19 (IMF presentation, see table). This was accomplished through substantial  on-budget revenue-expenditure compression, facilitated by financing some obligations off budget.  While the headline general government fiscal deficit narrowed meaningfully, thanks in part to a  decline in the fiscal deficits of the states, the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) remained  high. The PSBR includes borrowing by most central public sector undertakings (PSUs, borrowing by  state PSUs and by local governments is not included because of data unavailability). The path of the  PSBR in recent years suggests that fiscal policy has been more accommodative than what is implied  by the path of the general government deficit. This also explains why India’s general government  debt has remained high, at about 69 percent of GDP. But India’s debt profile is conducive to debt  sustainability, with debt largely held by residents, denominated in domestic currency, and with  relatively long maturity. The FY2019/20 central government budget envisages a reduction in the fiscal deficit of 0.1 percent of GDP (a reduction by 0.2 percent of GDP in the structural primary  balance, both IMF definition) but is again based on overly optimistic revenue targets, and the recent  reduction of corporate income tax rates makes achieving the budget targets increasingly unlikely. 
The macroeconomic outlook is more subdued and uncertain than in recent years. Growth is projected  at 6.1 percent in FY2019/20. Investment and private consumption are expected to firm in the second  half of the fiscal year. This is expected to be supported by the lagged effects of monetary policy  easing, recent measures to facilitate monetary policy transmission and address corporate and  environmental regulatory uncertainty, and government programs to support rural consumption being  rolled out. Over the medium term, growth is projected to gradually rise to its medium-term potential  of 7.3 percent on continued commitment to inflation targeting, gradual macro-financial and structural  reforms, including implementation of reforms initiated earlier, such as the Goods and Services Tax  (GST) and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), as well as ongoing steps to liberalize FDI  flows and further improve the ease of doing business.  
Inflation is projected to remain around 3.4 percent with the effect of subdued demand broadly  offsetting dissipating base effects of low food prices. The current account deficit is projected to  narrow marginally, to 2.0 percent of GDP. The balance of payments would return to surplus, on  returning capital inflows thanks to more accommodative global financial conditions. The rise in  protectionism and retreat from multilateralism could affect India directly through the trade channel  and indirectly through confidence effects and related effects on financial markets. While there may be  trade diversion toward India from the U.S.-China tariff escalation, the macroeconomic impact is  expected to be small given India’s relatively low trade openness and less diversified exports base. 
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Key domestic risks include tax revenue shortfalls and  delays in structural reforms. Credit growth could also remain subdued, as there is a perception of  increased risk aversion among banks and implementation of the recently announced PSB  consolidation could divert focus and weigh on near-term credit growth. The main external risks  pertain to higher oil prices, a sharp rise in risk premia in global financial markets, and rising  protectionism globally.
Executive Board Assessment2 
They noted that India’s rapid economic expansion in recent years has lifted millions of people out of  poverty. However, in the first half of 2019 a combination of factors led to subdued economic growth  in India. With risks to the outlook tilted to the downside, Directors called for continued sound  macroeconomic management. They saw an opportunity with the strong mandate of the new  government to reinvigorate the reform agenda to boost inclusive and sustainable growth. 
Directors noted that a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation path driven by subsidy-spending  rationalization and tax-base enhancing measures is needed to reduce debt, free up financial resources  for private investment, and reduce the interest bill. Some Directors advocated that automatic  stabilizers should be allowed to operate in the short run. Directors called for more robust revenue  projections and enhanced fiscal transparency and budget coverage.  
Directors recommended that near-term policies to address cyclical weakness focus on monetary  policy and broad-based macro-structural reforms. In this regard, they welcomed the monetary policy  easing undertaken so far this year and recommended that an easing bias be maintained at least until  the projected recovery takes hold. 
Directors noted that inflation targeting has contributed to macroeconomic stability by better  anchoring inflation expectations, thus helping improve the economic well-being of low-income  households. Continued action is needed to improve the monetary transmission mechanism to enhance  the effectiveness of monetary policy and enable the central bank to achieve the medium-term inflation  target on a sustained basis. Directors also welcomed the authorities’ commitment to maintain  exchange rate flexibility. They noted that foreign exchange intervention should continue to be  two-way and limited to disorderly market conditions. 
Directors welcomed the steps taken to tackle the twin bank and corporate balance sheet problem but  noted the continued challenges of the financial sector. They recommended that the recently  announced public sector bank merger plan be accompanied by deep operational restructuring and  far-reaching governance reforms in order to improve efficiency, risk management, and credit  allocation. Directors welcomed the strengthened monitoring and regulation of non-bank financial  companies and recommended enhancing the availability of timely and granular data to help restore  confidence in the sector. Directors urged further follow-up on the FSAP recommendations. 
Directors commended the authorities’ concerted efforts to strengthen the business climate. These  efforts need to be complemented by continued labor, product market, land, and other reforms aimed  at increasing labor market flexibility, enhancing competition, and reducing the scope for corruption.  This will help harness India’s demographic dividend by creating more and better jobs for the  rapidly-growing labor force and enhancing female labor force participation. Directors also welcomed  the important progress that has been made in strengthening the supply side of the economy through  large infrastructure investments. They noted that land reform remains essential to raise agriculture

sector productivity and achieve the authorities’ ambitious infrastructure development targets.  Directors also encouraged further trade and investment liberalization.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2019 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION 
October 16, 2019
KEY ISSUES 
Recent Developments: India has been among the world’s fastest-growing economies in recent years, lifting millions out of poverty. However, growth slowed to a six-year low in the first half of  2019, with both consumption and investment decelerating owing to weak, especially rural,  income growth, stresses in the non-bank financial sector, and corporate and environmental  regulatory uncertainty. On the external sector, following a rise in vulnerabilities in 2018, stability  has returned, anchored by high foreign reserve buffers and a modest current account deficit.  
Outlook and Risks: Amid domestic and external headwinds, the outlook for India’s growth in  FY2019/20 is more subdued than in recent years. In the staff’s baseline scenario, growth  gradually rises to its medium-term potential of 7.3 percent on continued commitment to  inflation targeting and gradual macro-financial and structural reforms, including implementation  of earlier reforms, such as the Goods and Services Tax and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,  as well as ongoing steps to liberalize foreign direct investment flows and further improve the  ease of doing business. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Key domestic risks  include tax revenue shortfalls and delays in structural reforms. The main external risks pertain to  higher oil prices, a sharp rise in risk premia in global financial markets, and rising protectionism. 
Key Policy Recommendations: With its strong mandate, the new government has an  opportunity to reinvigorate the reform agenda aimed at boosting inclusive and sustainable  growth. A comprehensive reform package is needed to guide the economy on a path to the  government’s goal of a US$5 trillion economy in five years: 
• In the near term, given the cyclical weakness of the economy, monetary policy should  maintain an easing bias at least until the projected recovery takes hold. Fiscal stimulus  should be avoided given fiscal space at risk and revenue losses from the recent corporate  income tax rate cut should be offset. In the event of external pressures, India should  continue to rely on exchange rate flexibility. Foreign exchange intervention should be two way and limited to disorderly market conditions. 
• For the medium term, a credible fiscal consolidation path is needed to reduce debt, free up  financial resources for private investment, and reduce the interest bill. To support the  adoption of a necessary medium-term fiscal consolidation, driven by subsidy-spending  rationalization and tax-base enhancing measures, revenue projections should be more  realistic and fiscal transparency and budget coverage should be enhanced. Governance of  public sector banks and the efficiency of their credit allocation needs strengthening, and the  public sector’s role in the financial system needs to be reduced. Labor, land, and product  market reforms aimed at enhancing competition and governance, along with infrastructure  investment, should be priorities to create more and better jobs for India’s rapidly-growing  labor force and enhance female labor force participation.

OVERVIEW 
1. Growth has been strong in recent years, but it has not been associated with broad based formal job gains and relatively low food prices have contributed to rural distress. India  has been among the fastest-growing economies in the world over the past few years, lifting millions  out of poverty. However, recent labor market data suggests that unemployment is high while labor  force participation has decreased, particularly for females. Without more inclusive and sustainable  growth, India’s potential demographic dividend over the next few decades, from its young and  rapidly-growing labor force, could be wasted.

Note: The 2017/18 data is based on the Periodic Labour Force Survey and is not strictly comparable to the earlier data which is based on the quinquennial NSSO Survey data2. The government’s renewed large Parliamentary majority provides an opportunity to  reinvigorate the reform agenda to boost inclusive and sustainable growth, building on the  
steps taken during its first term. The medium-term vision presented in the July 5 Budget Speech  which focuses on boosting investment is appropriate and so is the commitment to support the rural  economy, boost infrastructure spending, streamline the Goods and Services Tax (GST), reform direct  taxes, and pursue a business-friendly policy agenda. However, in the absence of bolder, front loaded reforms, medium-term growth will be held back.  
3. Implementation of past Fund advice has been mixed (Appendix VI). Monetary and  exchange rate policies have been broadly consistent with past Fund advice. But fiscal consolidation  was not undertaken at the level of the public sector borrowing requirement, with financing of some  obligations shifted off budget, and the important steps taken to address the twin bank and  corporate balance sheet problem have yet to be complemented by a decisive improvement in the  governance of public sector banks (PSBs) and a reduction of the government’s role in the banking  sector. Notwithstanding important advances in transportation infrastructure, electrification,  digitization, and the ease of doing business, progress on structural reforms aimed at boosting  inclusive and sustainable growth has been slower than advocated in previous Fund advice. 
4. The theme of this consultation is reform priorities to boost inclusive and sustainable  growth. Other priorities include enhancing fiscal transparency and refocusing on fiscal  consolidation to avoid crowding out; improving the efficiency of the financial system; further labor,  land, and product market reforms; resuming trade and investment liberalization; and strengthening  the regulatory framework and the rule of law to reduce the scope for corruption.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS 
5. Growth and structural reforms slowed ahead of the recent general elections and  investors and consumers have yet to abandon their wait-and-see approach. Stability-oriented  macroeconomic policies and progress with structural reforms in recent years helped weather bouts  of external pressures and, in 2018, stresses among non-bank financial companies (NBFCs). However,  economic activity weakened in the first half of 2019. Recent macroeconomic developments can be  summarized as follows (Table 2): 
• GDP growth slowed to a five-year low of 6.8 percent in FY2018/19 (April 2018-March 2019). The  
slowdown continued in the first quarter  of FY2019/20, with growth slipping to  20

Q
• Headline inflation averaged 3.4 percent in FY2018/19, an 8-year low. Successive normal  
monsoon rainfall, agriculture sector reforms, and food management improvements pushed  down food prices. After falling to 2.0 percent (y/y) in January, headline inflation rose to 3.2 percent in August but remains below the medium-term target band mid-point for headline  inflation of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, 4 percent CPI inflation ± 2 percent). CPI inflation  excluding food and fuel, at 4.2 percent, is down from a recent peak of 6.4 percent in June 2018 on slowing growth. 
• After rising through late 2018, external vulnerabilities fell through August 2019, on lower oil  prices and renewed portfolio inflows. In FY2018/19, the current account deficit (CAD) widened to  2.1 percent of GDP, on a rising oil import bill. Foreign direct investment (FDI) financed about half  of the CAD. In FY2018/19, the rupee depreciated by about 3.4 and 5.9 percent on average in real  and nominal effective terms, also reflecting portfolio outflows. The U.S. dollar value of non-oil  merchandise exports expanded by 6.6 percent, broadly maintaining India’s relatively modest  global export market share. Gross reserves declined by US$12 billion during FY2018/19 to  US$413 billion (7 months of imports), while the net forward position fell by US$34 billion. Gross  reserves rose to US$429 billion through end-August on renewed portfolio inflows. They remain  adequate at about 149 percent and 187 percent of the standard- and capital flow management  measures-adjusted IMF metrics, respectively. External debt remains low at 19 percent of GDP.  External financing looks sustainable but could be affected by domestic and external volatility.

• Based on data and projections through end-2018, India’s external position was assessed to be  broadly consistent with fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The current account gap for  2018, as assessed by IMF staff, is in the range of -1.0 to +1.0 percent of GDP, with an implied  staff-assessed REER gap of -6 to +6 percent. These estimates were published for all major  countries in the IMF’s External Sector Report in mid-July 2019. Appendix X provides an update. 
6. Macro-financial risks from banking sector weaknesses have decreased somewhat, but  some financial institutions continue to face difficulties. Recent pressures involving relatively  small institutions have been weighing on market sentiments. 
• The RBI has taken steps to improve recognition of non-performing assets (NPAs), especially in  PSBs, which account for 61 percent of the banking system’s assets. The regulatory and  supervisory framework has also been strengthened. In addition, because of substantial capital  injections from the government budget over the past two years and the initial results of the  implementation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), PSBs are now in a better position  to extend credit to the economy.  
• After peaking in March 2018, the banking system’s NPA ratio declined by 2.2 percentage points  to 9.3 percent in March 2019. The PSBs’ risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio (CAR) improved to  12.2 percent, with only one PSB remaining  
below the 9 percent threshold, in addition to  one private bank. In early 2019, five of 11 PSBs

• Credit growth remains uneven. Bank credit growth picked up in 2018, peaking at 14.3 percent  (y/y) in December 2018 with credit to industry showing signs of a recovery, although some of  that growth reflected PSB credit to NBFCs. More recently, credit growth slowed to 10 percent in  August. During recent years, private sector banks continued to see rapid credit growth (21  percent, on average, during the past five years), especially to the household sector. While  impairment levels are low so far, this could portend a buildup of risks in the future.

and 6.6 percent, respectively, had previously been filling the gap of anemic PSB credit growth.  
• Corporate sector deleveraging has continued at a gradual pace. Debt repayment capacity and  profitability—though improving—remain below historical averages. 
7. The macroeconomic outlook is more subdued than in recent years. 
• Reflecting the primarily cyclical slowdown, growth is projected at 6.1 percent in FY2019/20,  which would be the lowest in 7 years, and is expected to rebound to 7.0 percent in FY2020/21.  Investment and private consumption are expected to firm in the second half of the current fiscal  year. This is expected to be supported by the lagged effects of monetary policy easing, recent  measures to facilitate monetary policy transmission and address corporate and environmental  regulatory uncertainty, the recent reduction in corporate income tax (CIT) rates, and government  programs to support rural consumption. 
• Headline inflation is projected to remain around 3.4 percent with the effect of subdued demand  broadly offsetting dissipating base effects of low food prices. 
• The CAD is projected to narrow marginally, to 2.0 percent of GDP, on weaker domestic demand.  The balance of payments would return to surplus, on returning capital inflows thanks to more  accommodative global financial conditions. 
• The rise in protectionism and retreat from multilateralism could affect India directly through the  trade channel and indirectly through confidence effects and related financial market effects.  Recently, a retaliatory response was taken to decisions by the United States to raise tariffs on  steel and aluminum and to remove India from its Generalized System of Preferences lists. While  there may be trade diversion toward India from the U.S.-China tariff escalation, the  macroeconomic impact is expected to be small.

8. To illustrate the important policy decisions facing the authorities, staff prepared two  scenarios (see Table 1).  
• In the baseline scenario, growth rises to its medium-term potential of 7.3 percent on the  productivity-enhancing effects of recent reforms, including the introduction of the GST, as well  as a continuation of recent fiscal policies and gradual macro-financial and structural reforms.1 Inflation remains within the target band and the CAD at manageable levels. But in this scenario  the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) fiscal consolidation targets are not  achieved and labor market gains remain subdued.2 
• The reform scenario illustrates how a comprehensive reform package—with three key pillars— would boost inclusive growth. Structural reforms included in the package would help spur  productivity and employment growth and, over the medium term, more than offset the negative  growth impact of the proposed fiscal consolidation path that is more ambitious than currently  envisaged by the government: 
• First, the ongoing cleanup of bank balance sheets should be complemented by a decisive  strengthening of PSB governance and regulation and oversight of NBFCs.  
• Second, a medium-term fiscal consolidation path should be anchored by the FRBM Review Committee’s recommendation to reduce general government debt toward 60 percent of  GDP. As elaborated in the text table, this consolidation would rely upon expenditure savings  from rationalizing subsidies as well as revenue gains from expanding the tax base, especially  on personal income. Consolidation would address crowding out and financial repression  caused by the high public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR), which exceeds net  household financial saving (6.6 percent of GDP). Even still, these measures would lower the  debt-to-GDP ratio to only 62.4 percent by FY 2024/25—additional measures to offset the  estimated revenue loss from the recent CIT rate reduction would also be needed to achieve  the current FRBM debt target by FY2024/25. As examples, consideration could be given to  expanding property taxation, increasing the coal cess, and enacting equal tax treatment of  agricultural income with that from other sources. 
• Third, labor, product market, land, and other reforms aimed at (i) increasing labor market  flexibility, reducing duality between formal and informal sectors, and improving employment  opportunities; and (ii) enhancing competition and reducing the scope for corruption.  
1 The almost ½ percentage point reduction in medium-term potential growth compared to the staff report for the  2018 Article IV consultation reflects a structural weakening primarily owing to weakness in investment in recent years,  but still assumes some benefit from ongoing structural reforms including the GST and the recent CIT rate cut.  
2 Owing to a favorable growth-interest rate differential, debt is projected to remain sustainable, including under  stress scenarios (see Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA, Appendix V). Risks are further mitigated because public debt  is primarily denominated in domestic currency and held by residents.

1/ Growth effects of the fiscal consolidation scenario are assessed using the IMF’s Flexible System of Global Models (FSGM). The cumulative GDP level effect of the additional  fiscal consolidation (1.1 percent of GDP) is estimated to be about 0.5 percent. The relatively muted implied fiscal multiplier reflects a reduction in monetary policy interest rates  which provides some growth support, and the multiplier associated with subsidy expenditures is relatively small, especially since income support to the rural sector is now  provided through other central government schemes (e.g. PM-KISAN).
2/ The macroeconomic impact of labor and product market deregulation is based on Anand and Khera (2016). The estimated impacts are derived from a DSGE model with an  informal sector and rigidities in the formal labor and product markets characterizing the Indian economy.  
3/ A cumulative fiscal consolidation of 1.8 percent of GDP is recommended, from 2020/21 to 2023/24. This compares to a 0.7 consolidation in the baseline fiscal projection,  implying a marginal recommended consolidation of 1.1 percent of GDP. The recommended consolidation features additional expenditure savings of about 0.5 percent of GDP  from reducing subsidies (food, petroleum, and fertilizers) as well as tax revenue increases (GST = about 0.1 percent of GDP; personal income taxes = about 0.4 percent of  GDP). Personal-income-tax revenue gains could be achieved by eliminating exemptions (tax payers currently have no liability on income below about $7,000 USD, or about 3.5  times GDP per capita) and by increasing contributions of top earners—India’s personal income tax system has a top rate of 30 percent, lower than many countries in Asia.  Interest savings, attributable to the lower debt stock, account for the remaining 0.1 percentage point.

9. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside (Appendix I). Domestic risks include tax  revenue shortfalls beyond those anticipated in the baseline and delays, compared to the gradual  pace of reforms assumed in the baseline, in  
strengthening the balance sheets of PSBs and  corporates, and other structural reforms. Credit  growth could also remain subdued, as there is a  perception of increased risk aversion among  banks and implementation of the recently  announced PSB consolidation could divert focus

per barrel increase in oil prices, there is about a 17 percent chance that growth would drop below 5  percent in FY2019/20, compared to a 5 percent chance in the baseline (see text chart and Appendix  VIII).  
Authorities’ Views 
10. The authorities were more optimistic than staff on the outlook and risks. They expected  a relatively strong recovery in the second half of FY2019/20 aided by the recent CIT rate reduction and sector-specific measures in support of the automotive, real estate, and export sectors as well as micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Lagged effects of monetary easing, support to  NBFCs, and front-loaded bank recapitalization were expected to boost credit provision. They also  noted that the provisional national accounts estimates for the first quarter of the fiscal year were based on benchmark indicators and may change significantly in the revised estimates, to be released  in 2020, that are compiled based on detailed information by industries and institutions. In addition,  the authorities were confident that efforts to boost infrastructure investment and reforms to  improve the business climate and streamline labor market regulations would support activity and  raise India’s potential growth going forward. 
KEY POLICY ISSUES 
11. Staff’s macroeconomic policy advice. Policies to address cyclical weakness should be  focused on monetary policy and broad-based macro-structural reforms. Fiscal stimulus should  be avoided given fiscal space at risk. To support the adoption of a credible medium-term fiscal  consolidation path that reduces crowding out and achieves the government’s medium-term 60  percent debt-to-GDP target, the immediate focus should be on making revenue projections more  realistic and enhancing fiscal transparency and budgetary coverage. Consolidation would also reduce fiscal dominance, which has led to financial repression and could undermine central bank  credibility and operations. Staff’s advice on reforms to improve the efficiency of the financial system  is anchored by the 2017 FSAP recommendations (Appendix II). 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11 
INDIA 
A. Fiscal Consolidation and Enhanced Transparency and Budgetary  Coverage 
12. Despite a shortfall in revenues relative to ambitious targets, the central government  broadly adhered to its headline fiscal deficit objective, implying a small improvement in the  
on-budget fiscal balance in  
FY2018/19 (IMF presentation, text  table). This was accomplished through  substantial on-budget revenue expenditure compression, facilitated by  financing some obligations off budget  (see Appendix III). As a result, in the  government’s own accounting, the debt  stock in FY2018/19 was revised upward  by ½ percent of GDP in its July budget,  relative to its initial ‘revised’ estimate  released in February.

13. The states’ aggregate fiscal deficit is expected to have improved materially in  FY2018/19—to about 2.4 percent of GDP—due in large part to (capital) expenditure shortfalls vis-à vis budgets. The states’ reduced fiscal deficit marks an improvement from recent years in which  aggregate deficits exceeded 3 percent of GDP, reflecting primarily the costs associated with the  UDAY scheme under which states took over part of state electricity distribution companies’ debts  and losses in return for reforms, along with farm-loan waivers and Pay Commission awards.  
14. While the headline general government fiscal deficit narrowed meaningfully, the PSBR  
remains high. The PSBR includes borrowing by  most central public sector undertakings (PSUs,

15. The FY2019/20 budget envisages a reduction in the headline central government fiscal  deficit of 0.1 percent of GDP (a reduction by 0.2 percent of GDP in the structural primary  balance, both IMF definition). But over-optimism regarding revenue targets, further compounded by the recent CIT rate reduction for which no offsetting revenue or expenditure  measures have been announced, makes achieving the budget targets increasingly unlikely. 
12 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 
• Relative to provisional actual outturns for FY2018/19, corporate and personal tax revenues are  budgeted to increase by 15.4 and 23.2 percent (y/y)—the softness of economic activity in the  first five months of the fiscal year along with the recent reduction in CIT rates makes achieving  these targets especially challenging. Budgeted GST revenue targets a still-optimistic, but  somewhat lower growth rate (14.1 percent) and may garner support from administrative  measures to improve GST compliance, including ‘nudge’ techniques (an area where the IMF is  providing capacity-development (CD) support).  
• Increased non-tax revenues are expected to provide more budgetary support than in past years  (mainly customs and excise revenues). The RBI’s dividend transfer will be broadly in line with the  budget estimate (higher by only 0.02 percent of GDP), and the additional excess-capital transfer  (about ¼ percent of GDP) will be treated below the line in the IMF presentation, consistent with  international standards on fiscal reporting.  
• The rural farm income support scheme, first announced in February, is expected to add about  0.3 percent of GDP to spending in FY2019/20. 
• Staff projects central government net tax revenues at 6.7 percent of GDP in FY2019/20, based on  historical buoyancy rates and some additional assumptions, especially relating to the lowering of  CIT rates (which depresses revenues by about 0.5 percent of GDP) as compared to 7.9 percent of  GDP in the July budget estimates. In addition, staff expects both income tax and GST revenues  
to decline (as a share of GDP), relative to FY2018/19 estimated outturns, given weak economic  activity and considering monthly outturns to date. As was the case in FY2018/19, staff expects some compression of on-budget expenditure to accommodate the revenue shortfall, though the  fiscal deficit target (according to the authorities’ narrow definition) is likely to be missed by 0.5  percentage points. There remains a meaningful chance of a larger fiscal slippage this fiscal  year—especially when considering the IMF’s extended notion of the central government  deficit—absent additional measures to shore up revenues or curtail expenditures. A possible  interim dividend from the RBI, alongside greater disinvestment proceeds, could provide a slight  boost to revenues (the latter only in the authorities’ deficit presentation). 
16. Central government fiscal deficit outturns have fallen short of the desired medium term fiscal consolidation path articulated by the  
FRBM review committee. Achievement of an  interim fiscal-deficit target of 3.0 percent has been  delayed several times (text chart), and the initial

increased use of off-budget financing renders adherence to the headline deficit target less  meaningful, entailing also a less-favorable debt-reduction trajectory.  
17. India is assessed as having fiscal space at risk. As such, staff sees no scope to provide  fiscal stimulus at this juncture. The recent lowering of CIT rates should be offset with measures to  boost revenues or curtail expenditures (see discussion of reform scenario). Considering the overall  envelope of central government obligations, in FY2019/20 staff recommends holding constant (at  5.4 percent of GDP) its extended notion of the central government deficit (headline deficit plus NSSF  loans to PSUs and fully serviced bonds, see Text Table). Any growth impetus should instead come  from other measures (see sections on monetary policy and structural reforms). In the event of a  more severe economic slowdown than currently envisaged, any fiscal stimulus should be temporary,  focusing on measures to boost near-term growth such as immediate investment expensing, or  public infrastructure spending. 
18. Staff recommends a more ambitious medium-term consolidation path. This need is  made more urgent by the recent lowering of CIT rates which, in the absence of offsetting measures, would contribute to pushing general government debt to a 10-year high of 69 percent of GDP by  end-March 2020. Consolidation would reduce crowding out of private investment and create fiscal  
space (see Appendix III), including by reducing  India’s interest bill burden, which stood at 4.9  6 
percent of GDP in FY2018/19, well above peers  5 
(see Text Chart). Starting in FY20/21, the  4 
envisaged consolidation would have only a  3 
modest negative growth impact, which could  be further offset by the pursuit of bold

• A gradual reduction of subsidy spending on food, fuel, and fertilizers, the need for which is  lessened by increased economically-less-distortionary direct-benefit-transfers to farmers,  including through PM KISAN. 
• Increases in revenue collections, through two complementary reforms: 
o On GST, staff recommends increasing compliance by streamlining filing and refund  mechanisms, broadening the base (e.g., including electricity and petroleum products), and  simplifying the rate structure—adopting fewer rates—in line with past Fund advice and  analysis (2018 Staff Report and Selected Issues Paper). Staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts  underway on these points. 
14 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 
o Personal income tax collections could be increased by eliminating exemptions, reducing the  minimum threshold for tax payers,3 and by increasing contributions of top earners.4 On the  latter, the recent surcharge on top earners is a positive step in this direction. 
• The consolidation scenario assumes no further additions to off-budget financing of expenditure. 
19. In the context of the increasing significance of fiscal federalism, staff emphasizes the  importance of enhancing fiscal reporting and strengthening fiscal transparency (see Appendix  IV). Though documentation provided in the Union Budget is helpful in clarifying that fiscal policy is  somewhat more expansionary than suggested by the headline fiscal deficit, more could be done to  ease accessibility and interpretability of the budget. Further, the timeliness and comprehensiveness  of the fiscal data collected by the central government could be improved to support better fiscal  policymaking. The government should invest in public financial management processes and systems  which support more timely fiscal data collection at all levels of government, stronger coordination  by the Ministry of Finance, and sounder fiscal reporting. For India to comply with its G20  commitment to publish general government fiscal data on a quarterly basis in line with GFSM 2014,  the Ministry of Finance should take the lead in the process to collect fiscal data from each state  government, according to a shared calendar and template. Building on the extensive support  already provided by the South Asia Regional Training and Technical Assistance Center (SARTTAC) and the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) on fiscal reporting at both the center and state-levels, the  IMF stands ready to provide further CD on the government’s reform endeavors on these topics. Staff also proposes that the government requests FAD to conduct a Fiscal Transparency Evaluation based  on the IMF’s Fiscal Transparency Code. 
Authorities’ Views 
20. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s fiscal analysis, including on the importance  of medium-term fiscal consolidation, noting the progress in recent years towards reducing  the central-government fiscal deficit. They emphasized that the fiscal deficit follows the definition as given by the FRBM Act, which relates to “the deficit in the Consolidated Fund,” whereas  government debt also includes liabilities recorded in the Public Account, and financial liabilities of  entities owned or controlled by the government which it repays or services. In the current weak  economic environment, they indicated that automatic stabilizers should be allowed to function in  the near-term, emphasizing the importance of avoiding procyclical fiscal policy. 
21. The authorities argued that current fiscal year revenue projections were achievable.  Regarding direct taxes, the surcharge on top income earners (a 37 percent surcharge levied on the  tax liability of those earning more than about US$700,000), levy on share buy-backs of listed  companies (20 percent of the difference between issue and buy-back price), the ambitious faceless  assessment approach to tax administration and greater use of digitization can all be expected to  support revenues. A thorough assessment of whether budget assumptions are on track could only  
3 Tax payers currently have no liability on income below about US$7,000, or about 3.5 times GDP per capita. 4 India’s personal income tax system has a top (statutory) rate of 30 percent, lower than many countries in Asia.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15 
INDIA 
be conducted later in the year using data through September, when a greater portion of direct-tax  revenues are generally collected. On the GST, the authorities argued that ongoing efforts to improve  compliance should support greater tax buoyancy. Such efforts include the nudge program, which  seeks faster business compliance through ongoing interactions with tax officers, as well as the use of  real-time tax databases and digitization, including relating to tax-document cross-checking. For  indirect tax collection more broadly, the dispute resolution scheme for legacy taxes that were  subsumed by the GST can also be expected to boost revenues this fiscal year. The RBI’s surplus  capital transfer will be treated above the line in the government accounts, providing an impetus of  about ¼ percent of GDP vis-à-vis the July budget estimate. 
22. CIT reductions are expected to boost compliance and spur economic activity. By  encouraging the incorporation of new manufacturing firms, lowering the cost of doing business, and  easing the burden of tax compliance for existing domestic firms, lower tax rates are expected to  increase the corporate tax base in coming years, broadly offsetting any short-term revenue losses.  Thus, the authorities envisioned no need for additional revenue-boosting or expenditure-reducing  measures at this time. 
23. The authorities reiterated their commitments in the context of the second phase of the  G-20 Data Gaps Initiative. Among the provisions of that commitment, they confirmed their  intention to provide general government fiscal data on a quarterly basis by the G20 deadline of  2021.  
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy—Further Consolidating Credibility 
24. Inflation targeting (IT) has contributed to macroeconomic stability, better anchored  inflation expectations, and improved the economic wellbeing of low-income households.  
• Inflation acts like a regressive tax that is  
disproportionately borne by low-income  14 
households. Since the foundation was laid for 12 
adoption of the IT regime in February 2015,  10

adoption of IT.  
• Experience in other countries shows that building up monetary policy credibility is a gradual and  cumulative process. The full benefits of IT therefore take time to materialize. Against this  backdrop, staff welcomes the steps taken by the RBI to enhance its capacity to monitor and  forecast food prices, which should further improve IT implementation. Further gains in monetary

INDIA 
policy credibility and stabilizing inflation and inflation expectations can be achieved through  continued commitment to the IT regime, underpinned by clear central bank communication as  the economy experiences various real and financial shocks.  
• In August, the RBI cut the policy rate by 35 basis points (bps), a change from the traditional  policy rate moves by 25 bps or its multiples in recent years. While there is nothing sacrosanct  about policy rate actions in increments of 25 bps, predictability and a meaningful size of the unit  of increment can help market participants form a well-defined distribution of expectations about  future monetary policy actions, supporting efficient pricing of financial instruments, market  development, and monetary policy credibility. With regards to incremental monetary policy  actions, staff observes that, as shown by experience elsewhere, forward guidance accompanied  by market development can be an effective instrument in shaping market expectations.  
25. Recent monetary loosening has been largely appropriate, and there could be room for  additional easing, given domestic and external downside risks. Considering the sharper-than expected deceleration of economic activity amid subdued global growth and fiscal space at risk, the  recent easing in August has aligned the policy rate closer to the natural rate of interest (staff’s  midpoint estimate is 1.2 percent with a range of 0.7 to 1.7 percent reflecting model standard errors),  with consensus inflation expectations slightly below 4 percent. In October, the RBI’s Monetary Policy  Committee cut the policy rate by 25 bps to 5.15 percent, for a cumulative reduction of 135 bps,  since February 2019, a sizeable easing which would support the economy amid the negative output  gap but would take some time to play out, given monetary policy lags. As such, monetary policy  should maintain an easing bias at least until the projected recovery takes hold. 
26. The monetary transmission mechanism needs to be improved further to enable the RBI  to achieve the medium-term inflation target on a sustained basis. Monetary transmission can be  improved by enhancing competition in the banking system, encouraging banks to streamline credit  pricing, ensuring that the recently-mandated referencing of lending rates to external benchmarks  allows market-based pricing of credit risks, and reducing banks’ funding costs by passing through  changes in policy rates to administered interest rates (e.g., on NSSF certificates). Staff welcomes the  planned further reduction in the SLR to 18 percent by April 2020. On liquidity management, staff looks forward to the liquidity management framework review findings and recommends managing  any balance sheet risks from the long-maturity foreign exchange swaps contracted by the RBI earlier  this year.  
27. The expert panel on the RBI's Economic Capital Framework (the Bimal Jalan  Committee) has laid out new guidelines for the transfer of RBI profits and “excess capital.” Staff welcomes the report’s strong emphasis on the RBI’s resilience to support the complex needs of  a large emerging market economy. While noting that there is no one universal capital benchmark  level, staff welcomes that revaluation balances are considered only as risk buffers against market  risks and that these unrealized valuation gains are therefore not distributed. The implementation of  the transfer will have implications for the RBI’s balance sheet and liquidity management. These will  need to be clearly communicated with market participants. 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17

28. India should continue to rely on exchange rate flexibility and gradually liberalize  capital flows.  
• De jure and de facto restrictions hold back capital inflows. However, the authorities have  recently eased various capital flow management measures (CFMs, see IMF 2018 Taxonomy of  Capital Flow Management Measures and Appendix IX), in particular, raising the limits for foreign  portfolio investment (FPI) in government securities and external commercial borrowing and  expanding the application of the automatic route for FDI to more sectors, among other  measures.

• In staff’s projections, reserve coverage would remain adequate even in the event of higher oil  prices, but simultaneous capital outflows would pose a test. Faced with external pressures in  2018/19, the RBI allowed the exchange rate to depreciate significantly while also intervening in  the spot and forward foreign exchange market (about 1.8 percent of GDP) and easing various  CFMs. The intervention sales were of the same magnitude as the net purchases of the previous  year, illustrating the two-way nature of exchange rate management. Staff’s simulations suggest  that reserve coverage would remain adequate in case of a sustained 30 percent oil price  increase. However, in a more severe scenario with higher oil prices accompanied by one year of  moderate capital outflows, reserves coverage would fall below 100 percent of the ARA metric by  the end of the six-year forecast horizon. 
• Continued exchange rate flexibility would support further deepening and broadening of the  exchange markets, including the development of hedging instruments. Regarding the  intervention strategy, staff recommends that intervention be two-way and limited to disorderly  market conditions. In the event of severe external pressures, including from higher oil prices,  continued exchange rate flexibility complemented by tighter fiscal and monetary policies would  help contain the shock. Based on the DSA and FSAP stress tests, negative balance sheet effects  from a rupee depreciation would likely be contained. 
• Although the foreign currency issuance of sovereign bonds can help with benchmarking and  diversifying the investor base for government securities, associated costs, risks, and benefits  need to be assessed along with those of further increases in the FPI limits on nonresident  holdings of government securities. About the latter, consideration could be given to entering  
18 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 
global bond indexes, at least for some bonds, and facilitate clearance and settlement for  nonresident investors. 
Authorities’ Views 
29. The authorities concurred that continued commitment to the IT framework will be  important for consolidating monetary policy credibility and preserving macro-stability. Given  the negative output gap and low food prices, inflation pressures are expected to be well-contained  and below the RBI’s medium-term inflation target midpoint. The lagged impact of the cumulative  easing of 135 basis points this year is being closely monitored to decide on any additional easing to  help close the output gap. On the conduct of monetary policy, the authorities indicated that the  usefulness of estimates of the natural rate, especially in an emerging market context, is limited by  the imprecision of the estimates. They noted that a policy rate adjustment of 25 bps or multiples  thereof may not always be consistent with the evolving macroeconomic conditions, giving rise to  the need to calibrate the size of the rate adjustment. The authorities agreed on the need to further  improve monetary transmission and emphasized that linking the bank lending rates to external  benchmark rates would further help transmission. 
30. The authorities shared the view that the external position is broadly consistent with  economic fundamentals and policy settings. They agreed with the assessment of the current  account norm of -2.5 percent of GDP and noted that experience at times in 2018 underscored that  any higher level of the current account deficit can pose financing challenges. The authorities  confirmed their commitment to two-way exchange rate flexibility and pointed out that intervention  decisions should take a long view of the capital inflow-outflow cycle and be proactive, as  demonstrated by the Indian experience over the past two years. They reiterated that interventions  are only intended to smooth out excessive volatility. The authorities noted that the recent use of  longer-term foreign exchange swaps was driven by the need to expand durable liquidity  management tools beyond open-market operations, and the risks to the RBI balance sheet remain  limited, given the size of the operations. 
C. Financial and Corporate Sector—Building on Important Reforms 
31. Initiatives to address India’s twin balance sheet problem and underpin PSBs’ effective  financial intermediation continue to be implemented but governance reforms lag: 
• The resolution and recovery of assets under the IBC process helped lower the banking system’s  gross NPA ratio, and provisioning coverage improved to 60.6 percent (without write-off  adjustment) in March 2019. PSBs’ capital positions improved following the government’s two year recapitalization program. It is expected to be further enhanced by this fiscal year’s additional recapitalization, planned to be frontloaded to revive lending capacity. 
• Implementation of the IBC, supported by CD workshops organized by the Fund, is playing an  important role in shifting the balance of power between debtors and creditors. Several rounds of  amendments have been made to alleviate issues and clarify the interpretation of the law, 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19 
INDIA 
including the eligibility of bidders and the treatment of secured and unsecured creditors.  Around 120 cases have been resolved so far, with an average recovery rate of 43 percent. The  backlog of cases and the time it takes for the process to complete remain a challenge, and steps  are being taken to increase the capacity of the National Company Law Tribunal. The RBI released  new guidelines on the Resolution of Stressed Assets in June 2019 in response to a Supreme  Court ruling that the previous circular overreached on the RBI’s legal authority. The new  guidelines reduce the reliance on court procedures and provide more flexibility for banks to  design and implement resolution plans outside the IBC process, while providing disincentives  (additional provisioning requirements) for resolution delays.  
32. Important additional steps need to be taken to build on the progress with PSB reforms  so far. Staff’s cross-country analysis of banks in India and EM peers suggests that there is scope to  improve the efficiency of Indian banks, especially PSBs. 
• The government adopted a PSB reform plan along metrics such as responsible banking, financial  inclusion, credit offtake, and digitization. The first stock take of reform implementation was  released in February 2019. The more arm’s-length process of PSB management selection  undertaken by the Banks Board Bureau (BBB) and steps taken toward strengthening the  governance, functioning, and quality of PSB boards are welcome for enhancing efficiency. The  government should step up efforts to improve the risk management and operation of PSBs to  improve the efficiency of credit allocation.  
• The recently announced plan for PSB mergers should be accompanied by deep operational  restructuring and far-reaching governance reform, as well as safeguards to maintain the  soundness of the merged institutions. Unless supported by these measures, the merger would  not address the underlying need for better risk management and greater efficiency and could  result in larger and potentially weaker banks. Furthermore, the process could divert the focus  away from the banks’ core businesses and could affect their lending capacity in the immediate  future. While the mergers reduce the number of PSBs to 12, the large presence of the  government in the banking system will remain unchanged. 
33. Staff welcomes the strengthening of regulation and monitoring of the NBFC, including  the HFC sector. Funding conditions appear to have eased for some NBFCs, and there is greater  differentiation by financial market participants based on the underlying performance of firms.  Further to the earlier measures to ease liquidity conditions (e.g., asset purchases from NBFCs by  banks and the RBI’s liquidity provisions through banks), the government announced a temporary  and partial guarantee to PSBs for the purchase of high-quality assets from solvent NBFCs in the July  Budget. The RBI has enhanced its monitoring of and reporting from systemically-important NBFCs  and introduced more granular liquidity management requirements. Staff welcomes the transfer to  the RBI from the National Housing Bank (NHB) of the regulatory authority over HFCs. This can be  expected to reduce regulatory arbitrage. In addition, the promotion and financing of housing  finance (especially, affordable housing) and the supervision of HFCs, all currently under the NHB,  should be separated, given the potential conflict of interest. While the stress in the sector appears to  be contained to a few—albeit sometimes large—specific cases, continued vigilance is warranted on 
20 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 
spillovers to other parts of the financial sector and systemic implications. For this purpose, staff urges the authorities to enhance the availability of more timely and granular data including to the  public. The Fund stands ready to support these efforts through CD. An asset quality review for the  sector could also be considered. 
34. In line with the 2017 FSAP recommendations, staff recommends that the authorities  pursue far-reaching governance reforms that can be expected to lead to improved risk  management and more efficient credit allocation. This would involve continuing to strengthen  the quality and independence of banks’ Boards, removing RBI officials from PSB Boards, and more  aggressively pursuing PSB privatization and/or letting PSBs operate independently with  accountability to the government. Furthermore, legal changes should be made to formally enable  the RBI to ensure effective governance of PSBs, and subject PSBs fully to banking and corporate laws that apply to private banks. Regarding other recommendations from the 2017 FSAP, progress has  been made on implementing IFRS 9 and strengthening insurance and securities supervision and  regulations, while a mechanism for a resolution of financial institutions needs to be established and  frameworks for emergency liquidity assistance (ELA), deposit insurance, and crisis preparedness  should be improved (see Appendix II). 
Authorities’ Views 
35. The authorities agreed on the importance of governance reform and improving the risk  management of PSBs. They emphasized the progress made in enhancing PSBs’ governance and  operations, including the improvements in capital adequacy and NPA ratios, and the enhanced ability of PSBs’ management to enable a greater functional and technology focus and benefit from  economies of scale regarding digitization. A key focus of reforms was now on improving risk  management and the recently announced PSB mergers and accompanying reforms, including  allowing PSBs to hire chief risk officers at market-based salaries, is expected to lead to efficiency  gains and enhanced capacity to lend. The authorities stressed the importance that priority sector  lending (PSL) and the PSBs play in the economy, including to reach underserved segments of  society. They also noted that the RBI’s supervisory power over banks are agnostic to ownership, and  do not agree on the need for legal changes to formally provide the RBI full supervisory powers over  PSBs. Regarding the ELA, the authorities value the constructive ambiguity and flexibility provided by  the current framework, and do not publish its internal guidelines to avoid moral hazard. 
36. The authorities highlighted the effectiveness of the measures taken to address stress in  the NBFC sector. Measures were implemented to effectively improve the sector’s liquidity  conditions and allow asset-liability management issues to be addressed. In addition, the RBI’s  regulatory and supervisory powers over NBFCs have been enhanced, and the transfer of regulation  of HFCs to the RBI would reduce the potential for regulatory arbitrage.

D. Structural Reforms—Boosting Investment and Inclusive Growth 
37. To support inclusive growth, structural reforms need to be reinvigorated. Since the  1980s, wide-ranging structural reforms to deregulate, open, and make the economy more  competitive have contributed to vastly improved living standards, with the share of the population  in poverty decreasing significantly. However, India’s income per capita remains relatively low, and  income disparities are widening. Moreover, unlike some other emerging market economies, India‘s  manufacturing sector remains relatively small. These reflect rigidities in labor, land, and product markets. 
38. Concerted efforts have been made to strengthen the business climate and encourage  investment and trade, but initiatives aimed at reducing corruption and increasing  bureaucratic efficiency have had only limited success.

process, the opportunities for corruption are reduced markedly, such as through faceless  assessments in the case of tax payments. 
Trade Policy Issues 
39. There is still ample room to reduce trade barriers further. Staff welcomes efforts to  decrease trade documentation, streamline trade procedures, and expand infrastructure investment  focusing on supply-chain logistics, including last-kilometer connectivity. Nevertheless, tariffs are  relatively high and being changed frequently. Trade costs and processing times remain relatively  high. Reportedly, the main obstacles on services trade are restrictions on foreign entry and on  movement of people, barriers to competition, and lack of regulatory transparency. 
40. Resuming trade liberalization and reforms to facilitate trade and investment will help  support growth and job creation and expand India’s role in the world trade system. Further  reduction of barriers to goods and services trade—tariffs and non-tariffs—will ultimately benefit  India. Staff’s analysis suggests continued trade and investment liberalization could further support  India’s trade and economic growth and help integrate India into global value chains (IMF APD  Departmental Paper Is South Asia Ready for Take Off? A Sustainable and Inclusive Growth Agenda). More openness will help India transform and diversify, thus supporting the creation of more and  better-quality jobs with a more substantial boost to employment potentially from increasing  manufacturing exports. FDI inflows to India have been robust. The bulk of foreign investments are  now allowed to enter most sectors of the Indian economy under the automatic route. Going  forward, it is important to continue to put in place policies that create a conducive environment for  investment and enhance policy certainty, including on sectoral policies and tariffs.

Labor Market Reforms 
41. An important priority is modernizing labor regulations and other measures to help  increase formal employment, especially of women. Labor laws need to be updated and  streamlined, including to reduce restrictive employment protection and not discriminate by  enterprise size. By providing disincentives for firms to expand to their optimal size, they stifle  productivity growth and formal sector job creation. In this regard, analysis in the latest Economic  Survey illustrates the benefits of more flexible labor market regulations at the state level. Reforms  would also allow India to reap the full benefits from a more integrated national market due to the  implementation of the national GST. Past Selected Issues Papers suggests a multi-dimensional  approach—using a range of fiscal, legal, and structural measures—could be used to maximize long run economic gains and to promote greater economic participation of women. Considering this,  making amendments to and strengthening the implementation of various gender-specific labor laws  and investing in gender-targeted skills training programs are needed to increase female  employment in better quality jobs in the formal sector. Strengthening the implementation and  awareness of females’ land inheritance rights and financial literacy programs could also help address  remaining constraints to their usage of financial services. 
42. Staff’s analysis highlights important opportunities to exploit new digital technologies  to help improve female labor force participation and narrow gender gaps Building on the  success of the JAM trinity (the initiative to link Jan Dhan (bank) accounts, Mobile numbers, and  Aadhaar unique identify numbers), the rapid increase in bank account ownership and mobile phone  availability can help enhance access to and lower costs of financial services, thus allowing women to  utilize financial services to support their economic activities—saving, borrowing, investing, and  making payments. Digital marketing platforms, including through the Mahila e-Haat initiative, can  provide access to new markets and revenue opportunities, thus connecting women entrepreneurs in  remote areas with limited mobility to markets to sell produce and goods. Job-matching platforms  could also help improve labor market information flows, cut time for job search, and improve labor  market efficiency. This would have particular benefits for people living in remote areas and those  looking for part-time work, thus encouraging women to enter the workforce.  
Infrastructure and Product Market Reforms 
43. In line with government plans, further emphasis should be put on addressing  infrastructure bottlenecks. In recent years, the supply side of the economy has been strengthened  through large investments in airports, roads, telecom, and power generation. Nevertheless, there is a  general recognition that getting to sustainably higher growth will require more action on addressing  infrastructure bottlenecks. The government has announced ambitious plans in this regard. The new  target is to invest Rs. 100 trillion (about US$1.4 trillion) over the next six years. This would involve  more than a doubling of infrastructure investment from the pace of the last five years.  
44. To achieve a sustained increase in such investment, it will be important to redouble the  efforts that are being made to address the sources of delays in implementing infrastructure  projects. Bottlenecks include delays in land acquisition, environment and forest clearances, stressed 
24 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 
balance sheet of private companies involved in infrastructure investment, and overdependence on  bank lending for financing of infrastructure. Regarding the latter, efforts are being made to promote  institutional investment into infrastructure from pension, insurance, and sovereign wealth funds  through various modalities, including brownfield asset monetization using vehicles such as Toll  Operate Transfer and Infrastructure Investment Trusts. 
45. Sustained inclusive growth requires continued agricultural sector reforms. This should  include reducing supply-side constraints, building more integrated markets, boosting productivity,  and addressing market distortions. Improving agricultural productivity is important to support the  reallocation of labor resources to other sectors (e.g., manufacturing and services) while improving  
living standards in rural areas. The agricultural sector is benefiting from the gains in rural  electrification, which help with the post-harvest process (e.g., cold storage), as well as the ongoing  expansion of the rural road network. For instance, staff’s analysis indicates that infrastructure  development is associated with increased integration of wholesale agriculture markets.  
46. Land acquisition should be eased by reforming the land acquisition law. There is also a  need to step up efforts, especially at the state level, to compile a full digital land registry and  simplify the regulatory approval process for environmental and other clearances. States that have  advanced in terms of liberalizing land leasing and computerization of land records appear to have  benefitted from stronger increases in agricultural productivity.  
47. Staff welcomes the Agricultural Export Strategy approved in late-2018. There is  considerable scope to expand India’s agriculture exports. The planned coordinated approach to  improve export quality would be consistent with the government’s objective to raise farmers  income. A stable regulatory environment, including regarding tariffs and restrictions will be key.  
Authorities’ Views 
48. The authorities concurred that comprehensive reforms to make growth stronger and  more inclusive and sustainable are needed. In particular, the authorities recognized the need for  continued labor, land, infrastructure, and product-market reforms. While expressing concern about  implementing reforms in a weak growth environment, they agreed that politically, the time—early in  the government’s second term—is right for a structural-reform push, as was done in the  government’s first term. The authorities noted that labor laws are being updated and streamlined.5 While they recognized that the decline in labor force participation rate is worrisome, they  underscored that this was partly due to the young population increasingly spending more years in  education and skills training, which would likely support India’s economic potential in the future. The authorities noted steps taken to help increase women’s economic participation. This included recent  amendments to the Maternity Benefit Act 2017, child-care subsidies, and schemes to support  
5 Steps have been taken to draft four Labor Codes. This involves simplifying, amalgamating, and rationalizing the  relevant provisions of the existing central labor laws. The Code on Wages Act was notified in August. The Code on  Occupational Safety, Health, and Working Conditions was introduced in parliament in July. The other two codes, on industrial relations and on social security and welfare are in the pre-legislative stage.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 25 
INDIA 
education, women’s safety, and infrastructure. On efforts to improve governance, the authorities  highlighted the drive to introduce faceless tax assessment and refund processes, which should help  limit direct interactions between tax officers and payers, thereby reducing corruption in tax  administration. The authorities were pleased that efforts to improve the ease of doing business were  now visible in India’s improved global ranking. Further reform efforts were ongoing. 
E. Statistics and Additional Capacity Development 
49. While macro-economic statistics are adequate for Fund surveillance, further CD is  warranted. On national accounts data, the new producer price index under development could help improve the deflators used to calculate GDP and a recently-conducted survey of services could help  the measurement of the informal sector at the time of the next rebasing. The authorities should also  re-consider how revisions were made to the back-casted series (for data during 2004/05-2011/12).  The Fund stands ready to intensify its support for improving statistical systems through CD. 
50. There is scope to further expand the Fund’s CD activities in priority areas. The Fund’s CD  activities with India have been scaled up in recent years (Appendix VII). As highlighted in earlier  parts of this report, recent activities and collaboration with the authorities has improved targeting to  country needs. 
Authorities’ Views 
51. The authorities expressed satisfaction with the Fund’s support for CD in several areas.  They appreciated assistance through SARTTAC and for the 15th Finance Commission, especially on  fiscal issues, and suggested the need to follow up on areas where they agreed with the Fund’s  recommendations. The Indian statistical authorities emphasized their commitment to modernize  their statistical system. On labor market statistics, they noted that changes to survey and sample selection methodology may affect the comparability of labor market statistics across time. 
STAFF APPRAISAL 
52. Following rapid economic expansion in recent years, growth slowed to a six-year low in  the first half of 2019. India has been among the fastest-growing economies in the world, lifting  millions out of poverty. However, a loss of momentum during the past year in both consumption  and investment was exacerbated by weak income growth and stresses in the non-bank financial  sector. Corporate and environmental regulatory uncertainty may also have impacted business and  investment decisions. Weak demand and continued low food prices contributed to a further  moderation of inflation to a multi-year low.  
53. The macroeconomic outlook is more subdued than in recent years. Investment and  private consumption are expected to firm in the second half of the fiscal year. This is expected to be  supported by the lagged effects of monetary policy easing, recent measures to facilitate monetary policy transmission and to streamline regulations, and government programs to support rural  consumption. Over the medium-term, growth is expected to benefit from the productivity-
26 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 
enhancing effects of recent reforms, as well as continued gradual macro-financial and structural  reforms. 
54. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Domestic risks include tax revenue  shortfalls and delays in strengthening the balance sheets of PSBs and corporates (which could lead  to weak lending) and other structural reforms. External risks pertain to oil price volatility, a sharp rise  in risk premia in global financial markets, and rising protectionism.  
55. Near-term policies to address cyclical weakness should focus on monetary policy and  broad-based macro-structural reforms. Fiscal stimulus should be avoided given limited policy  space. The FY2019/20 budget envisages a small reduction in the fiscal deficit but the overly  optimistic revenue targets and the recent reduction in CIT rates makes achieving the budget targets  increasingly unlikely.  
56. With its strong mandate, the new government has an opportunity to reinvigorate the  reform agenda aimed at boosting inclusive and sustainable growth. A comprehensive reform  package is needed to guide the economy on a path to the government’s goal of a US$5 trillion  economy in five years. Medium-term fiscal consolidation and financial sector reforms should be  complemented by continued labor, product market, land, and other reforms aimed at increasing  labor market flexibility, enhancing competition, and reducing the scope for corruption. These will  help harness India’s demographic dividend by creating more and better jobs for India’s rapidly growing labor force and enhancing female labor force participation.  
57. A credible medium-term fiscal consolidation path that is more ambitious than currently  envisaged by the government is needed to reduce debt, free up financial resources for private  investment, and reduce the interest bill. Consolidation would also reduce fiscal dominance, which  has led to financial repression and could undermine central bank credibility and operations. A  
consolidation path, aimed at bringing general government debt down to the officially-adopted  target of 60 percent of GDP, should be driven by subsidy-spending rationalization and tax-base  enhancing measures. In support, revenue projections should be more realistic and fiscal  transparency and budget coverage should be enhanced. An extended notion of the government’s  fiscal envelope—which includes NSSF loans to central government PSUs and fully serviced PSU  bonds, in addition to the headline fiscal deficit—should be held constant this fiscal year, and fiscal  consolidation on this metric should resume in FY2020/21. 
58. The loosening of monetary policy has been largely appropriate and further easing  could be warranted. The sizeable easing of monetary policy effected so far this year supports the  economy amid the negative output gap. Given the cyclical weakness, monetary policy should  maintain an easing bias at least until the projected recovery takes hold.  
59. To enable the RBI to achieve the medium-term inflation target on a sustained basis,  continued action is needed to improve the monetary transmission mechanism. Monetary  transmission can be improved by enhancing competition in the banking system, including through  PSB governance reforms and by reducing the government’s footprint in the banking system, 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 27 
INDIA 
encouraging banks to streamline credit pricing, and reducing banks’ funding costs by passing  through changes in policy rates to administered interest rates (e.g., on NSSF certificates). 
60. More progress is needed in tackling the twin balance sheet problem, resurrecting PSBs’  effective financial intermediation, and restoring confidence in NBFCs. Capital injections from  the government budget and the initial results of the implementation of the IBC have improved PSBs’  capital position and asset quality. The recently announced PSB merger plan, which could divert focus  and weigh on near-term credit growth, should be accompanied by deep operational restructuring  and far-reaching governance reforms that can be expected to lead to improved risk management  and more efficient credit allocation, including by considering more aggressive disinvestment and  privatization. The authorities are encouraged to follow up on the FSAP recommendations, including  to amend the legal framework to provide the RBI full regulatory powers over PSBs. Building on steps  taken to strengthen the monitoring and regulation of NBFCs, enhancing the availability of timely  and granular data could help restore confidence in the sector. 
61. India would benefit from further liberalization and reforms to facilitate trade and  investment. India’s CFM framework is moving in the general direction of capital account  liberalization. Most FDI is now allowed to enter sectors of the Indian economy under the automatic  route, but there is scope to further reduce administrative and regulatory burdens and improve  governance building on gains made in improving the ease of doing business. Further liberalization  in portfolio flows could be considered, while remaining vigilant to risks of capital flow reversals. As a  strong advocate of the multilateral rules-based trade system, India is encouraged to play a bigger  role in the world trade system. 
62. India’s external position is assessed to be broadly consistent with fundamentals and desirable policy settings, with international reserves adequate for precautionary purposes. Exchange rate flexibility played an important role in helping to weather bouts of external pressures  in 2018 and should continue, with foreign exchange intervention being two-way and limited to  disorderly market conditions. 
63. Modernizing labor regulations and other measures to help increase formal employment  and employment of women is a priority. In view also of India’s low female labor force  participation, further modernizing labor laws would encourage productivity growth and formal  sector job creation, as well as reduce labor market rigidities that push down labor force  participation. 
64. Achieving sustainably higher inclusive growth will require continuing to address infrastructure bottlenecks and agricultural sector reforms. In recent years, important progress  has been made in strengthening the supply side of the economy through large infrastructure  investments. Land reforms remain essential to raise agriculture sector productivity and achieve the  new government’s ambitious infrastructure development targets. Similarly, the initiatives to build  more integrated markets and address market distortions will raise productivity in the agricultural  sector by reducing production risk, increasing competitiveness, and improving transparency in state

agricultural markets. Important gains can be expected from implementation of the new agriculture  export policy. 
65. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12- month cycle.

<U+2192> Recommended Policy Actions
Fiscal revenue 
shortfalls related to 
the GST
Domestic 
H 
ST, MT 
M
Protracted GST implementation issues could jeopardize the FY2019/20 deficit target. This would support growth in  the near term but would raise borrowing needs and market interest rates and crowd out private investment. <U+2192>Enhance GST compliance including through further rate structure simplification, streamlining filing and refund  mechanisms and strengthening tax administration.
Public banks (PSBs),  corporates, and NBFCs  remain weak for longer
Domestic 
M 
ST, MT 
M
Protracted processes in dealing with asset quality problems, maintaining the pace of lending in the newly-merged  PSBs, repairing corporate balance sheets, and straightening out NBFC may hamper investment and growth. <U+2192>NPL resolution processes should be sped up, PSBs’ governance improved—with a reduced role of the public  sector—and NBFC’s oversight strengthened.
Setbacks in the 
structural reform 
process
Domestic 
H 
ST, MT 
M
Slow progress in reforming labor, land, and product markets, including agriculture, could weigh on investment and  growth, and wane investor sentiment.  
<U+2192>Continue to facilitate state-led reform initiatives, address long-standing supply bottlenecks, and strengthen  the business climate.
Rising protectionism  and retreat from  
multilateralism 
External 
H 
ST, MT 
M
The United States may further tighten imports from trading partners, including India. India’s own protectionism  measures could be broadly contractionary and reduce incentives for businesses to compete and improve efficiency. <U+2192>Enhance integration into global value chains by facilitating trade liberalization, reducing barriers to trade, and  
advancing export sophistication and quality. Broader structural reforms (e.g., labor, land, and product market  reforms would increase the benefits from trade liberalization.
Sharp tightening of 
global financial  
conditions
External 
M 
ST 
M
An abrupt deterioration in market sentiment (e.g., prompted by policy surprises, renewed stresses in emerging  markets, or a disorderly Brexit) could trigger capital account pressures, creating funding pressures for the current  account (CA) deficit. Economic growth could fall, reinforced by asset price corrections and confidence effects of  rupee depreciation. 
<U+2192> Enhance the environment for attracting stable non-debt creating capital flows, particularly FDI. Rupee  flexibility and monetary policy tightening. 
Large swings in energy  prices

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective  assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“L” (low) is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “M” (medium) a probability between 10 percent and 30 percent, and “H” (high) a probability of 30 percent or  more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Policies to Address Vulnerabilities
Improve the governance and  financial operations of PSBs and  develop a strategic plan for their  consolidation, divestment, and  privatization.
MoF 
S 
Under Implementation: 
• The January 2018 Banking Reforms Roadmap lists six “reform themes”, including strengthening PSBs; increasing credit supply; and deepening financial inclusion and  digitalization. A first assessment of reform progress was released in February 2019. 
• More recently, more leadership posts were created at PSBs by separately appointing non-Executive Chairpersons alongside the post of CEO/Managing Director. The Banks  Board Bureau (BBB), established by the government in 2016 as an autonomous  recommendatory body, is now responsible for advising the government, including on the  selection and appointment of Board of Directors in PSBs; matters relating to appointments,  confirmation or extension of tenure and termination of services of the Board of Directors,  and suitable training and development programmes for management personnel in PSBs. 
• Plans announced in August involve enhancing PSBs’ management accountability to the  Board. PSBs can now recruit Chief Risk Officers from the market. The terms of directors on  the Board’s Management Committee will be extended to strengthen their contributions, the  loan sanction thresholds for approval by Management Committee of Board (MCB) were  raised to enable more focused attention to higher-value loan proposals, and a mandate  was given to Boards for training directors and evaluate their performances annually.  
• The number of PSBs will be reduced from 21 to 12. Three PSBs were merged in March.  A majority stake in a PSB was sold to the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of  India. Finally, in August, it was announced that 10 PSBs would be merged into 4 PSBs.
Conduct granular assessments of  banks’ capital needs and require  additional provisions and swift  recapitalization and  
restructuring.
RBI, MoF 
S 
Under Implementation: 
A recapitalization plan was announced in October 2017, with a view to clean up legacy NPAs,  support credit growth, and have PSBs meet regulatory capital requirement. INR 881 billion was  infused in FY2017/18. The capital injection in FY2018/19 was raised from INR 650 billion to INR  1.06 trillion. An additional INR 700 billion is budgeted for FY2019/20, of which bank-wise capital  infusion for 10 PSBs, totaling INR 552.5 billion, has already been announced based on granular  assessment of capital requirements. Since the third quarter of 2018, the BBB conducts quarterly  assessments of PSB capital requirements. These are reported to the Government and the RBI.

Redesign the corporate debt  restructuring mechanisms to  make them more flexible.
RBI 
S 
Implemented: 
The Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets issued by the RBI on Jun 7, 2019  lays out the principles underlying the new regulatory approach, including early recognition and  reporting of default; discretion of lenders to design and implement resolution plans (RPs); and a  system of disincentives for delays in implementation of RPs. It eliminated mandatory referral  (under the previous circular of February 2018) of stressed accounts under the Insolvency and  Bankruptcy Code (IBC), but puts the onus on banks to devise a suitable RP. RPs can be tailored  to specific requirements of the borrower and the respective commercial considerations of the  lenders, subject to certain boundary conditions to establish implementation of a resolution plan  as well as certain prudential requirements to ensure that only viable resolution plans are  implemented. Wherever necessary, the RBI will issue directions to banks for initiation of  insolvency proceedings against borrowers for specific defaults.
Financial Sector Oversight Framework
System-wide oversight and  
macroprudential policies 
- Retain regulators’ role in  collecting firm-level  
data.
MoF 
M
Implemented: 
The provision of direct collection of data from regulated entities has been dropped from the  draft Financial Data Management Centre (FDMC) Bill, and the regulators’ role in collecting data  from the regulated entities has been retained. However, data may be collected directly by  FDMC only when regulators are not able to provide data.
Banking supervision 
- Review loan classifi 
cation and provisioning  
rules in the context of  
IFRS, and with respect to  
special loan categories. 
- Amend the legal  
framework to provide  
the RBI with full  
supervisory powers over  
PSBs and clarify its legal  
independence.

Under Implementation: 
10-member Steering committee was formed in Sep 2017 to implement risk-based capital (RBC)  regime. Consultancy Evaluation Committee (CEC) has been formed and is in process of finalizing  request for proposal document to be issued to the consultants shortlisted. A project committee  of IRDAI to study and develop an appropriate framework for risk-based supervision (RBS)  submitted a report in November 2017. An Implementation Committee was formed in January  2018, which submitted its interim report in June 2018. IRDAI circulated its intention of moving  towards RBS Framework circulated to insurance companies in October 2018. Central Points of  Contact (CPoC) were designated for 5 insurance companies on a pilot basis in November 2018,  and expression of interest was released in March 2019 for consultancy services for development  and implementation of RBS Framework.
Securities regulation 
- Transfer legal authority  over public-listed  
company reporting to  
SEBI and introduce a  
risk-based review of  
company disclosures. 
- Adopt a strategy to unify  regulation of  
commodities trading  
markets.
Government, SEBI
M 
S
Under implementation: 
The Companies Act 2013 (CA-13) provides minimum requirements for company with respect to  preparation, circulation, filing and review of various disclosures through specified reports/returns.  It provides for constitution of National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) as an independent  regulator for audit to ensure complete independence, thoroughness and accountability on the  part of auditors. Arrangements for information sharing between the Ministry of Corporate Affairs  (MCA) and SEBI exist, which is simultaneous, and timely disclosure of information is required on  the exchange platforms by the companies. SEBI has specified additional sectoral requirements  for listed companies through various regulations. SEBI issued a circular in May 2018 to further  streamline the procedures relating to non-compliance with all relevant provisions of Listing  Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (LODR) and a dedicated division monitors the  compliance. SEBI is also in the process of developing a smart aggregator of financial and other  publicly available information filed by listed companies.  
Under Consideration: 
An Expert Committee to study and promote creation of an operational and legal framework to  integrate spot market and derivatives market for commodities trading was set up on June 13,  2017. It submitted its report along with recommendations on February 12, 2018, many of which  have already been implemented by RBI/ SEBI.

M
In Process: 
The Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill, which would accommodate the  recommendations on crisis management framework, was introduced in the Lok Sabha in  August 2017 and subsequently referred to a Joint Committee of Parliament. However, the Bill  was withdrawn from Parliament in August 2018. It is under examination and reconsideration. In Process: 
The issues relating to duplication of supervisory authority in the pre-resolution phase,  strengthening of resolution tools and safeguards, recovery and resolution plans, treatment of  domestic and foreign liability holders, and matter of crisis preparedness are expected to be  adequately accommodated in the ongoing reconsideration of the Bill, in consultation with the  RBI. 
Not Implemented: 
Emergency liquidity assistance. The RBI has a Board-approved lender of last resort (LOLR) policy  in place, that incorporates constructive ambiguity and flexibility that would help limit risk of  moral hazard. 
Deposit Insurance. At present DICGC functions primarily as a pay box entity. The FRDI Bill 2017 contained a provision of government grants, in addition to the Resolution Corporation’s (RC)  power to charge a premium for providing deposit insurance.  
Under Implementation: 
Crisis preparedness. Under the Financial Stability and Development Council framework, it has  recently been decided to further strengthen the ‘Early Warning Group (EWG)’ and the frequency  of EWG meetings has also been increased from once in three months to at least every two  months.

Not implemented:  
The definition of politically-exposed persons remains as those who have been entrusted with  public functions in a foreign country, including Indians serving in high positions in a foreign  country. 
Tax evasion through foreign income and assets is a predicate offence to money laundering  (Section 51 of the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax  Act, 2015). While domestic tax evasion qualifies as a tax crime in the Indian context, it has not  yet been made a predicate offence to money laundering.

Appendix III. Public Sector Borrowing, Private Savings and  Crowding Out 
1. Despite India’s rapid economic growth, general government public debt has continued  to hover around 68 percent of GDP during the past seven years. Fiscal consolidation efforts have  focused on bringing down the deficit of the central government. However, the reduction of the  general government deficit has been hampered by India’s complicated fiscal federalism architecture,  intricate central and state governments’ PFM systems, as well as the government’s large role in  many sectors of the economy, including through public enterprises whose costly operations, losses,  and bailouts often fall on the government. As a result, India’s general government deficit and debt  are among the highest in emerging market economies.

1 The definitions currently used by the authorities for fiscal deficit and for debt create the potential to misread the  central government’s fiscal stance. As per the FRBM Act, the central government debt and deficit concepts cover  different scopes of fiscal operations. The deficit is limited to flows recorded under the Consolidated Fund, while the  debt, on top of the accumulation of deficits over time, also includes liabilities recorded in the Public Account, as well  as financial liabilities of entities owned or controlled by the central government which it repays or services. As a  result, while the headline deficit has been declining in recent years, the decline in central government debt has not  kept pace.

requirement (PSBR). Staff’s preliminary estimates suggest that the PSBR has risen to about 8.5  percent of GDP. The resulting high debt causes India’s interest bill to be around 5 percent of GDP  which is considerably higher than in BRICs and ASEAN peers. 
3. Staff encourages the authorities to broaden efforts to collect data on government  finances with a view to arrive at comprehensive estimate of the PSBR. Ideally, one entity in the  government should be tasked with compiling comprehensive data on public sector debt. Staff welcomes the additional information provided in Statement 27 of the FY2019/20 budget and the  authorities’ confirmation of their intention to work toward compiling quarterly data, in line with  GFSM 2014, on the general government fiscal balance in the context of the G20 Data Gaps Initiative.  Staff’s estimate of the PSBR uses information from Statement 25 (Resources of Public Enterprises),  excluding the “internal resources” component, as a proxy for the total off-budget borrowing of  PSUs. A subset of this estimate pertains directly to the government’s debt stock and is shown  below—this estimate comprises information from Statement 27 (Statement of Extra-budgetary  Resources (Govt Fully Serviced Bonds)) and Annex 8 (Sources and Application of National Small  Savings Fund).2 Yet some elements are missing from this calculation. To arrive at a more  comprehensive estimate of the PSBR, data on several additional components is needed, most  notably on the borrowing of state-level public enterprises and on the fiscal balance of lower tiers of  government. Furthermore, it is likely that the central government deficit under GFS standards will  
cover a broader definition and include the  
balances of operations of funds and

4. The high public sector borrowing requirements hold back India’s catch-up with more  advanced countries. The high borrowing requirements tie up financial resources that would  otherwise be available for private investment (“crowding out”). In addition, the high interest bill  reduces the room for government social and infrastructure spending.  
5. At the same time, household net financial savings declined below the PSBR. Since  FY2009/10, net financial savings almost halved, falling by 5.4 percent of GDP, from 12 percent of  GDP in FY2009/10 to 6.6 percent of GDP in FY2017/18. As shown in the bar on the right-hand side,  eighty percent of this decline came from the reduction in gross financial savings. As of FY2016/17  
2 The data for FY2018/19 is an estimate; it relies on partial budget information and additional information from the  Food Corporation of India website. 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 55 
INDIA 
(the latest available data point with a breakdown in the national accounts data), the largest decline  in gross financial savings came from the reduction in currency holdings following demonetization,  recording a drop of 3.6 percent of GDP. It is possible that some of the currency holdings recovered  
in FY2017/18, given the improvement in gross financial savings by 2 percent of GDP. The second  largest decline came from the 1.4 percent of GDP reduction in savings in insurance funds. Savings in  shares, deposits, and claims on government dropped by 0.5, 0.4, and 0.3 percent of GDP,  respectively. While to some extent these developments can be driven by demographics, with  younger persons less prone to save, and greater financial development and inclusion, it also  suggests that steps need to be taken to improve the confidence in the financial system so that more  of the national savings can be intermediated into productive investment. 
6. The sensitivity of interest rates to changes in public sector borrowing in the domestic  
market—and hence the likely growth enhancing crowding-in effects of efforts to  9 
contain public sector borrowing—has been  on display on several occasions. For  8 
instance, yields on 10-year government bonds  declined considerably in response to the  
7 
recent budget announcement about a  6 
possible foreign sovereign bond issuance.  There was a similar decline in yields when a  5

Appendix IV. Enhancing Fiscal Reporting and Fiscal Transparency 
1. Staff recommends improving coverage and comprehensiveness of India’s fiscal  reports. Although states are responsible for more than half of total expenditure, there is currently  no reporting of intra-year fiscal data at the general government level. In this regard staff welcomes  the authorities’ confirmation of their intention to start compiling and disseminating such data on a  quarterly basis, in line with GFSM 2014, by 2021 in the context of the G20 Data Gaps Initiative. Very  little fiscal information is collected about state-level PSUs or about lower tiers of government  (municipalities, panchayats). And despite clear efforts at both Union and State government levels to  strengthen reporting on assets and liabilities, India mostly operates under a cash accounting basis,  which provides a limited view of the government’s fiscal performance and use of resources. The  absence of nonfinancial asset registers and the limited monitoring of multiyear commitments are  among the most significant gaps in this regard. These shortcomings place India behind the majority  of G20 economies in terms of institutional coverage, frequency and comprehensiveness of fiscal  reports. 
2. Staff recommends that the government invest in processes and systems which support  sounder fiscal reporting in the context of fiscal federalism. This includes establishing clear  obligations for States to report fiscal data to the Union regularly, according to a shared calendar set  by the center, and possibly setting financial incentives for states to report on a timely basis; fully  aligning the Chart of Accounts across all tiers of government to facilitate the consolidation of  information at the central level; further integrating central and state-level IT financial management  systems to facilitate timely data exchanges; and setting a medium-term strategy for the shift to  accrual accounting at both the Union and state levels, anchored by explicit objectives and  milestones. These public financial management reform areas are part of the scope of the work of the  15th Finance Commission, as set by its terms of reference.  
3. Fiscal reports should allow investors, markets and the general public to better  understand the government’s actual fiscal stance. A growing amount of information on the fiscal  position of entities other than the budgetary central government is available to the public, including  details on extra-budgetary resources alongside the Union Budget, or the report on state finances  published by the RBI. Yet, the release of more data does not necessarily imply more transparency.  Information is scattered across many documents and websites, making it difficult for economic  agents to obtain a full account of the use of public resources on which to base their decisions and  choices. Further, there are very few published forward-looking analyses of the fiscal risks borne by  the Union and state governments, respectively, in many cases due to the absence of proper  monitoring processes in the first place. The recent assumption by the state governments of liabilities  from the DISCOM highlights the need for deeper oversight of state-level PSUs both by the Union  and state governments. Overall, instead of leaving that task to the media and analysts in financial  institutions and think tanks, the Union and state governments should consider providing more user friendly and forward-looking information and narratives, alongside or ahead of their budgets, for  example as part of a fiscal strategy statement. And the contents of the budget documents should be  standardized across the Union and state governments, in order to ensure that citizens in all states  have equal access to fiscal information.

Appendix V. Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis 
India’s debt is high, but favorable debt dynamics and financial repression make the debt path sustainable—the statutory liquidity requirement creates a captive domestic market for debt which  limits the interest cost of debt. Risks are further mitigated because public debt is denominated in  domestic currency and predominantly held by residents. Under the baseline, the public debt-to-GDP  ratio would decline from about 69 percent in 2018/19 to about 66 percent of GDP by 2024/25, while  gross financing needs would decline from 11.4 percent to 9.4 percent of GDP. The primary risk to debt  sustainability stems from shocks to real GDP growth and fiscal slippages. India’s external debt, at  about 19 percent of GDP, remains sustainable. 
Public Debt Sustainability 
1. India’s debt-to-GDP ratio is high at about 69 percent of GDP. Over the medium term debt is projected to decline to around 66 percent of GDP driven by favorable debt dynamics.  Nominal GDP growth is projected to increase from about 10 percent to just below 12 percent over  the medium term and effective interest rates are projected to remain close to 8 percent. Inflation  over the medium term is forecast to be stable around 4 percent. India’s debt-stabilizing primary  deficit is calculated at 2.6 percent of GDP. 
2. India’s public debt sustainability analysis is based on the following macroeconomic assumptions: 
• Growth assumptions. Growth is projected to be 6.1 percent in 2019/20 and rise gradually  to 7.3 percent in the medium term. Robust medium-term growth will be driven by a  moderate pickup in investment associated with the recent CIT rate cut, and increases in  intra-Indian trade because of efficiency gains from the GST. The medium-term growth  forecast has been revised downward compared to the last DSA because of somewhat slower  than projected complementary land and labor reforms which are needed for a sustained rise  in investment and a further acceleration in growth. 
• Fiscal Assumptions. The central government fiscal deficit was estimated to be 3.8 percent  in FY 2018/19 (IMF presentation), as on-budget revenue expenditure was curtailed (moved  off budget) to accommodate a shortfall in both direct tax and GST revenues. This value was  unchanged in the IMF presentation, relative to the previous FY. A deterioration (0.7 percentage points) is expected in FY 2019/20 amidst substantial economic weakness and  the recently announced CIT rate reduction. 
3. Fiscal Risks. 
• The center has committed to fill the gap potentially arising from GST-related revenue  shortfalls in states. Specifically, the center has guaranteed states’ annual revenue growth at  14 percent for a period of 5 years from the implementation of GST. Because of this, GST

INDIA 
revenue slippages would affect the central government budget through higher transfers to  the states. 
• State fiscal deficits have frequently breached the 3 percent limit recommended by the 14th Finance Commission, largely due to the assumption of electricity distribution company  (DISCOM) debt. Going forward, risks remain substantial and stem from announcements of  farm loan waivers in several states, and the taking on of operating losses from electricity  generation corporations as stipulated in the UDAY scheme. Assessing these risks is  complicated by the lag in the availability of data on states’ fiscal positions. 
4. India’s debt profile is conducive to debt stability. Nearly 95 percent of debt—covering  the central and state governments’ debt— has a medium and long-term maturity, and debt is  largely held by residents. Foreign-currency-denominated debt is negligible. The composition of debt  is set to remain the same over the projection period with the bulk of financing needs met by the  issuance of medium and long-term debt denominated in domestic currency and held by residents.  The interest bill is substantial with gross financing needs equivalent to about 11.4 percent of GDP.  As fiscal consolidation resumes, these needs will decline by around 2 percent of GDP over the  medium term. The statutory liquidity requirement creates a captive domestic market for debt which  limits the interest cost of debt. 
5. Projections over the medium term are reasonable according to the assessment in the template. Assumptions on fiscal consolidation are within the median for surveillance countries and are expected to be met. Past forecast errors in projecting real GDP growth and the primary balance are reasonable with a percentile rank around 50 percent for each. Relative to past  projections, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline more slowly, owing to weaker tax revenue  collections. 
6. The primary risk to India’s debt sustainability is low growth, though the risks remain contained. The stress test corresponding to a growth shock yields a deteriorating debt path with debt-to-GDP reaching a peak of about 71 percent of GDP and gross financing needs  reaching a peak of about 12 percent of GDP. The combined macro-fiscal shock pushes debt up to 72  percent of GDP, though its path would stabilize by 2022—the growth impact (5.7 percent in FY  20/21) in this scenario broadly mimics the tail risk growth outcome (with 10 percent probability)  discussed in the GaR analysis (Appendix VIII). 
7. Vulnerabilities well-contained in the heat map despite high baseline debt-to-GDP ratio. Under most shocks, debt sustainability metrics are contained, thanks largely to relatively  strong nominal GDP growth in the baseline scenario. Risks stemming from market perception  (measured by EMBI global spreads), external financing requirements (defined as the current account  balance and amortization of short-term external debt) are the lone cases where the 70 percent  threshold is breached, under the shock and baseline scenarios, respectively.

External Debt Sustainability  
8. India’s external debt has stabilized at a moderate level. External debt declined to 19  percent of GDP at end-FY2018/19. Of which, about a half was denominated in US dollars and  another 36 percent in Indian rupees. Long-term external debt accounted for about 80 percent of the  total. Short-term external debt on a residual maturity basis stood at 43 percent of total external debt  and 55.8 percent of foreign exchange reserves. Compared with other emerging market economies,  India’s external debt remains moderate.  
9. External debt sustainability is robust to interest rate and GDP shocks, but is more  sensitive to current account and exchange rate shocks (Figure 6 and Table 1). A widening of the  current account deficit would cause external debt to rise moderately, where a permanent ¼  standard deviation shock to the non-interest current account balance would increase external debt  to about 23 percent of GDP by FY2024/25. The shock related to real exchange rate depreciation  appears to have the largest impact. In the scenario analysis, a 30 percent depreciation in FY2020/21  would raise external debt to around 26 percent of GDP followed by a gradual increase to 27 percent  of GDP by FY2024/25.

Appendix VI. Uptake of Previous IMF Advice 
Implementation of past Fund advice has been mixed. Monetary and exchange rate policies have been broadly consistent with past Fund advice but fiscal consolidation was not  undertaken at the level of the public sector borrowing requirement, with financing of  some obligations shifted off budget, and the important steps taken to address the twin bank and corporate balance sheet problem have yet to be complemented by a decisive  improvement in public sector banks’ (PSBs) governance and a reduction of the  government’s role in the banking sector. Notwithstanding important advances in transportation infrastructure, electrification, digitization, and the ease of doing business,  progress on structural reforms aimed at boosting inclusive and sustainable growth has on  the whole been slower than advocated in previous Fund advice. 
• The stance of monetary policy over the past 12 months was appropriate.  o The two policy rate hikes in the summer of 2018, amid elevated core inflation and  future inflation risks were consistent with the Fund’s call to aim monetary policy at  anchoring inflation expectations and building monetary policy credibility.  o Recent steps to loosen monetary policy, represent a proper response to cyclical  weakness in growth and headline inflation in the bottom half of the target range.  • With revenues falling short of the overly optimistic targets, the government did not  achieve its FY2018/19 fiscal consolidation target as advocated in previous Fund advice.  The slippage is larger if the increasing reliance on off-budget spending is taken into  account. As a result, general government debt rose despite favorable debt dynamics.  • Important steps are being taken to address the bank and corporate balance sheet  problems and revive credit. Progress has continued on recognizing and resolving non performing assets, as well as on recapitalizing the public sector banks (PSBs). However,  little progress has been made in restructuring PSBs or improving their governance,  including by reducing the government’s role in the banking sector, as advocated in  previous Fund advice.  
• Progress on further liberalization of trade and reforms to facilitate trade and investment  has been mixed. Various capital flow management measures (CFMs) have recently been  eased, allowing for more foreign portfolio and direct investment inflows, as well as  external commercial borrowing. On the other hand, trade tariffs were raised on selected  items.  
• The authorities’ response to episodes of capital outflows in the spring and fall of 2018  was broadly in line with past Fund advice. This involved a combination of exchange rate  flexibility, intervention sales in the spot and forward foreign exchange market, as well as  the easing of CFMs mentioned above. The authorities only tightened monetary policy  due to inflation pressures and not additionally in the face of substantial capital outflows. 
• Progress made in areas that are key to boosting inclusive and sustainable growth have  on the whole been slower than advocated in previous Fund advice. Important advances  in transportation infrastructure, electrification, digitization, and the ease of doing  business go in the direction of past Fund advice. However, these efforts and reforms have  not been complemented by labor and product market reforms advocated in previous  Fund advice.

Appendix VII. Recent and Planned IMF Capacity Development 
1. The Fund’s capacity development (CD) activities with India have been scaled up in  recent years. IMF technical assistance (TA) and training have supported the authorities’  efforts to enhance the formulation and implementation of sound macroeconomic and  financial policies as well as build institutions and capacity, including at the sub-national  level. Examples include the introduction of the inflation targeting framework, banking  sector stress testing, the modernization of the insolvency regime, the design of the Goods  and Services Tax (GST) and the fiscal responsibility framework, and the strengthening of  macroeconomic statistics. 
2. Upon its inauguration in February 2017, the South Asia Regional Training and  Technical Assistance Center (SARTTAC) has become the focal point for the delivery of IMF  CD services to India and South Asian countries. As highlighted in its FY2019 Annual Report,  SARTTAC extensively provided training and TA in the Fund’s core areas of expertise such  as training on national accounts, BOP/IIP statistics, and public financial management. A  course on supervision of market and operations risks was delivered at the RBI in January  2019. A government finance statistics/public sector debt statistics program is evolving  mainly at the subnational level in collaboration with the Office of the Comptroller and  Auditor General. A total of 678 Indian officials received training in FY2019 through  SARTTAC, up from 377 in FY2018. 
3. In line with the Fund’s CD strategy, 
• Recent activities and collaboration with Indian authorities has improved targeting to  country needs. At the request of the 15th Finance Commission, APD and FAD have delivered  on a pipeline of TA missions to provide the Fund’s analysis and assistance in developing  approaches to handle issues on fiscal federalism. These issues included assisting on  constraints on state budgets, achieving vertical fiscal balance, and incentivizing greater fiscal  discipline among states, including through market discipline. In addition, an APD/SARTTAC  monetary policy workshop was held in September 2018 to provide a forum for knowledge  sharing on evolving monetary policy frameworks in India, Nepal, and Bhutan. 
• CD activities have been further integrated with surveillance and IMF policy advice. To  improve the policy orientation of budget documents, SARTTAC has assisted the budget office  in India’s Ministry of Finance in preparing a draft fiscal strategy statement. SARTTAC’s work at  the sub-national level in India is addressing the sizeable capacity building needs among the  states, which carry out more than half of total government spending and hence play an  important role in efforts to enhance fiscal transparency and budget coverage. Key vehicles  include courses on macro-fiscal policy analysis tailored for the Indian states, delivered during  November 2018, January 2019 and April 2019. Considerable work has also been done  regarding training for state officials on fiscal reporting and on TADAT, a tax administration  diagnostic tool.

Appendix VIII. Growth-at-Risk Analysis 
1. The Growth-at-Risk (GaR) framework is a macro-financial surveillance tool. The  evolution of macro-financial vulnerabilities and changes in the domestic and external financial  conditions can provide important signals about evolving risks to future economic activity (Prasad  et al, 2019). The GaR analysis helps to quantify macro-financial risks to growth, assess the relative  importance of the macro-financial factors that impact the entire probability distribution of future  GDP growth—rather than only the central forecast, and monitor how risks to economic activity  may evolve over time. The analysis thus provides a basis for preemptive policies to mitigate  downside risks. 
2. The GaR analysis for India focuses on the likely impact of financial conditions and  macroeconomic vulnerabilities on future growth. Macroeconomic and financial variables are  categorized into three partitions: financial conditions, macroeconomic vulnerabilities, and other  
factors (Table 1).1 Financial conditions capture both the domestic and global price of risks  embedded in asset prices, the cost of funding, and the degree of domestic and global financial  stress. The second partition is of relevance in the Indian context where economic vulnerabilities  have largely driven historical growth and other macroeconomic conditions. Other factors include  variables affecting external demand such as global growth and trading partners’ imports. The  analysis is based on quarterly from April 2001 to March 2019. 
Table 1. List of Macro-Financial Variables for India’s GaR Analysis 1/ 
Financial Conditions Macroeconomic Vulnerabilities • Private sector credit growth 
• Oil price 
• Repo policy rate 
• Current account balance 
• 10-yr government bond yield 
• Inflation 
• Sovereign spreads 
• Ratio of short-term external debt to  
foreign reserves 
• Portfolio flows 
• Exchange rate change 
1/ Variable selection largely depends on data availability and macroeconomic importance in the Indian  context. Macro-financial variables such as bank capital, non-performing loan ratio, corporate and  household vulnerability were considered but excluded from the analysis due to data limitations. Other  factors that are likely to influence future growth such as external demand and external financing  conditions are also included.
3. Tightening financial conditions are found to be a meaningful predictor for  downside risks to growth. Using principal component analysis, the financial conditions index  (FCI) is constructed by extracting the first principal component from a collection of six financial

INDIA 
variables. As shown in Figure 1, the FCI is found to be a good leading indicator of GDP. The sharp  tightening of financial conditions during the 2008 global financial crisis, 2011 European debt  crisis, as well as 2013 Taper tantrum preceded episodes of economic slowdown in India (Figure  1). More recently, financial conditions tightened in the first half of 2018 related to an Emerging  Market sell-off and concerns over increased public borrowing. Since then, financial conditions  have gradually eased. 
Figure 1. Financial Conditions and GDP Growth
4. Variations in macroeconomic vulnerabilities drive financial flows and growth  prospects. In particular, the Indian economy depends heavily on imported oil. The net oil import  bill amounted to about US$94 billion in FY2018/19, equivalent to about 3½ percent of GDP or a  fifth of merchandise imports. An increase in international oil prices, therefore, directly affects the  economic outlook, with a widening current account deficit raising concerns over external  financing and rising inflation affecting real disposable income and private consumption, and  ultimately growth. The macroeconomic vulnerability index constructed by extracting the first  principal component from a collection of four variables appears to capture the level of systemic  risk in India as it is closely correlated with growth outcomes. Importantly, the international oil  price is identified as a factor that strongly influences India’s future growth with higher prices  exacerbating vulnerabilities (Figure 2).
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 71 
INDIA 
Figure 2. Macroeconomic Vulnerabilities and GDP Growth
5. Given improved financial conditions and macroeconomic vulnerabilities, India’s real  GDP growth in FY2019/20 is projected to recover gradually to 7 percent under the  baseline. The GaR result suggests there is a 5 percent chance that the Indian economy will grow  by at most 5 percent, and there is a 10 percent chance that growth will fall below 5.7 percent in  FY2019/20 (Figure 3). Risks to the outlook are slightly tilted to the downside, although the  probability of a recession is less than 1 percent in FY2019/20. 
Figure 3. Growth Distribution
6. Scenario analysis suggests a rise in oil prices could drive growth below the baseline  projection and downside risks to growth would rise (Figure 4). The scenario assumes a US$10  per barrel increase in the oil price compared to the baseline. The scenario analysis suggests  growth would likely slow to 6.8 in FY2019/20. In addition, the distribution of expected growth  outcomes in FY2019/20 is markedly skewed to the left, indicating significantly higher downside  risks to growth. For instance, there is a 5 percent chance that growth drops below 1.5 percent in  FY2019/20, compared to a 5 percent chance of it dropping below 5 percent in the baseline.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2018 Article IV Consultation with India 
On July 18, 2018, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the  Article IV consultation with India.1 
Stability-oriented macroeconomic policies and progress on structural reforms continue to bear  fruit. Following disruptions related to the November 2016 currency exchange initiative and the  July 2017 goods and service tax (GST) rollout, growth slowed to 6.7 percent in FY2017/18, but a  recovery is underway led by an investment pickup. Headline inflation averaged 3.6 percent in  FY2017/18, a 17-year low, reflecting low food prices on a return to normal monsoon rainfall,  agriculture sector reforms, subdued domestic demand, and currency appreciation. With demand  recovering and rising oil prices, medium-term headline inflation has risen to 4.9 percent in May  2018, above the mid-point of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s headline inflation target band of  4 percent ± 2 percent. External vulnerabilities remain contained but have risen. The current  account deficit (CAD) widened to 1.9 percent of GDP in FY2017/18, on rising imports and oil  prices. Gross international reserves rose to US$424.5 billion (about 8 months of prospective  imports of goods and services) at the end of March 2018, but declined to US$407.8 billion in the  third week of June 2018. Persistently-high household inflation expectations and large general  government fiscal deficits and debt remain key macroeconomic challenges. Systemic macro financial risks persist, as the weak credit cycle could impair growth and the sovereign-bank  nexus has created vulnerabilities.  
The near-term macroeconomic outlook is broadly favorable. Growth is forecast to rise to 7.3  percent in FY2018/19 and 7.5 percent in FY2019/20, on strengthening investment and robust  private consumption. Headline inflation is projected to rise to 5.2 percent in FY2018/19, as  demand conditions tighten, along with the recent depreciation of the rupee and higher oil prices,  housing rent allowances, and agricultural minimum support prices. The current account deficit is  projected to widen further to 2.6 percent of GDP on rising oil prices and strong demand for  imports, offset by a slight increase in remittances. As inflation pressures have risen, monetary  policy was tightened in early June 2018. Fiscal consolidation is expected to resume in  
1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A  staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic  developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the  Executive Board. 
FY2018/19, with the FY2018/19 Union Budget deficit target of 3.3 percent of GDP (equivalent  to 3.6 percent of GDP in IMF terms). Financial sector reforms have been undertaken to address  the twin balance sheet problems, as well as to revive bank credit and enhance the efficiency of  
credit provision by accelerating the cleanup of bank and corporate balance sheets. Over the  medium-term, the outlook will continue to improve with growth expected to rise to 7¾ percent,  and macro-financial and structural policies are priorities to help boost inclusive growth and  harness the demographic dividend. 
Economic risks are tilted to the downside. On the external side, risks include a further increase in  international oil prices, tighter global financial conditions, a retreat from cross-border integration  including spillover risks from a global trade conflict, and rising regional geopolitical tensions.  Domestic risks pertain to tax revenue shortfalls related to continued GST implementation issues  and delays in addressing the twin balance sheet problems and other structural reforms. 
Executive Board Assessment2 
Executive Directors welcomed the strong economic growth and commended the authorities for  the important and wide-ranging reforms. While noting the broadly positive outlook, Directors  observed that risks are tilted to the downside from external factors, such as higher global oil  prices and tighter global financial conditions, as well as domestic financial vulnerabilities.  Against this background, they underscored the need for continued prudent macroeconomic  policies and renewed emphasis on macro-financial and structural reforms. 
Directors noted that continued fiscal consolidation is needed to reduce public debt. They stressed  the need to take advantage of the projected acceleration of growth to achieve a public debt level  of 60 percent of GDP by FY2022/23, as recommended by India’s Fiscal Responsibility and  Budget Management Review Committee. Directors also emphasized the need to reach this year’s  budget target and to take corrective actions if required. In this context, they encouraged the  authorities to enhance goods and service tax compliance, while noting the scope for continuing  to simplify the framework.  
Directors supported the recent tightening of monetary policy. With upside inflation risks, further  gradual tightening was likely needed to anchor expectations and maintain monetary policy  credibility. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to a flexible exchange rate, noting  that foreign exchange intervention should remain two-sided and limited to addressing disorderly  market conditions. 
Directors stressed the need to focus on macro-financial and structural policies, and welcomed a  range of complementary initiatives taken to address high non-performing loans in public sector

banks and the large corporate sector leverage. They underscored the importance of accelerating the implementation of these initiatives, backed by a comprehensive plan to improve the  governance, internal controls, and operations of public sector banks, including by considering  more rapid withdrawal of public ownership. 
Directors welcomed that the capital flow management framework was moving in the direction of  greater liberalization, notably in the area of foreign direct investment. They stressed that India  would benefit from further liberalization of trade and foreign investment, and welcomed the  authorities’ commitment to a multilateral rules-based trade system.  
Directors emphasized the importance of modernizing labor laws and regulations and other  measures to help increase formal employment, particularly the employment of women. They  considered that these measures would lead to increased productivity growth and help India  harness the demographic dividend from the large number of younger workers. 
Directors welcomed the important progress that has been made in strengthening the supply side  of the economy through large infrastructure investments. Land reforms remain essential to  facilitate and expedite infrastructure development, to raise productivity in the agricultural sector,  and to foster rapid inclusive growth.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2018 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION  
July 2, 2018 
KEY ISSUES  
Context: India has been among the fastest-growing economies in the world over the past few  years, lifting millions out of poverty. The authorities have initiated important structural reforms  to spur India’s catch up with more advanced economies and to improve living standards for all.  
The main reforms include the inflation-targeting monetary policy framework, the Insolvency and  Bankruptcy Code (IBC), the goods and services tax (GST), and steps to liberalize FDI flows and  improve the business climate. 
Outlook and Risks: Following transitory disruptions, growth is projected to recover in  FY2018/19 and strengthen in FY2019/20 as stability-oriented macroeconomic policies and  progress on structural reforms continue to bear fruit. High foreign reserve buffers and strong FDI  inflows have helped contain external vulnerabilities. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the  downside. Key external risks—higher global oil prices and tighter global financial conditions— have grown in recent months, placing a premium on prudent policies. Domestic risks include tax  revenue shortfalls and delays in addressing the twin bank-corporate balance sheet problems.  
Key Policy Recommendations: A key focus of this consultation is macro-financial and structural  policies to boost inclusive growth, including to harness the demographic dividend. As the  economy recovers and given limited policy space and growing risks, India would now be served  best by supply-side measures.  
· Continued fiscal consolidation is needed to lower elevated public debt levels, supported by simplifying and streamlining the GST structure. 
· With the output gap closing and inflation rising, monetary policy will need further gradual tightening. 
· India’s external position remains broadly consistent with fundamentals. In the event of external pressures, India should continue to rely on exchange rate flexibility, and foreign exchange intervention should be two-way and limited to disorderly market conditions. 
· Important steps have been taken to improve the recognition of non-performing assets (NPAs) and recapitalize public sector banks (PSBs), but more needs to be done. The IBC has the potential to improve significantly NPA resolution and corporate debtors’ repayment discipline. A recent large fraud at a PSB highlights financial sector weaknesses and underscores the need for the government to take further steps to improve the PSBs’ governance and operations, including by considering more aggressive disinvestment. 
· While important progress has been made, key structural challenges remain. Needed policies include labor market, land, and product market reforms, which will raise investment, job growth, and productivity.

OVERVIEW  
1. A key focus of this consultation is macro-financial and structural policies to boost  inclusive growth, including to harness the demographic dividend.1 While India has been one of  the fastest-growing large economies in recent decades, investment growth has been comparatively  modest and formal job growth insufficient. This creates challenges for creating jobs for a young and  growing population and sustaining inclusive growth.

2. Important reforms have been implemented in recent years. This includes the inflation targeting monetary policy framework, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy code (IBC), the goods and  services tax (GST), and steps to liberalize foreign direct investment (FDI) flows and the ease of doing  business (Appendix I). A further deepening and broadening of structural reforms is needed to raise  investment, job growth, and productivity over the medium term, to spur India’s catch up with  advanced economies and create jobs needed for India’s young and growing labor force. The  priorities should be to enhance several important recently implemented reforms—e.g., further steps  on financial sector reforms and simplifying and streamlining the GST—combined with a vigorous  push for labor, land, and product market reforms.  
3. General elections will be held by May 2019. Against this background, government policies  have shifted mainly to accelerating implementation of ongoing reforms rather than initiating new  ones. And budget pressures could increase in the coming months. 
4. Macroeconomic policies have been broadly consistent with past Fund advice. The  stance of monetary policy over much of FY2017/18 was appropriate and consistent with the Fund’s  call to aim monetary policy at durably lowering sticky inflation expectations, given the temporary  weakness in growth and headline inflation at the lower end of the target range. Partly because of  one-off factors, including the introduction of the GST, the government did not achieve its FY2017/18  fiscal consolidation target as advocated in previous Fund advice. Important steps are being taken to  address the bank and corporate balance sheet problems and revive credit. Recent reforms to rigid  labor laws, most notably through the extension of fixed-term contracts to sectors beyond textiles

and leather, go in the direction of past Fund advice, but further reforms to labor laws, trade policies,  infrastructure, and product markets are needed.  
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS  
5. Stability-oriented macroeconomic policies and progress on structural reforms  continue to bear fruit, despite transitory disruptions to economic activity. Key macroeconomic  developments in FY2017/18 include (Figures 1–8, Tables 1–8):  
· GDP growth slowed to a 4-year low of 6.7 percent, but a recovery is under way. Following a  recovery from disruptions related to the November 2016 demonetization (Box 1) and the July  2017 GST rollout (Box 2), growth reached 7.7 percent in the quarter through March 2018 (y/y).  
· Headline inflation averaged 3.6 percent, a 17-year low, reflecting low food prices on a return to  normal monsoon rainfall and agriculture sector reforms (e.g., pulses buffer stock, national  agriculture market, crop insurance, and irrigation), subdued domestic demand, and currency  appreciation. However, with growth recovering and the output gap narrowing to -0.3 percent of  potential GDP (staff estimate), inflation is now on the rise with core (6.2 percent in May, y/y) and  headline (4.9 percent) inflation now above the mid-point of the target band for headline  inflation of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and inflation expectations over the forecast horizon  still elevated.  
· External vulnerabilities remain contained but have risen. The current account deficit (CAD)  widened to 1.9 percent of GDP, on rising imports and oil prices. But capital inflows have  remained strong and helped finance the bulk of the CAD. In response to these inflows, the RBI  intervened to limit the appreciation of the Indian rupee (INR) to about 3.1 and 1.4 percent on  average during 2017/18 in real and nominal effective terms (according to the IMF’s Information  Notice System). Gross international reserves rose by US$54.6 billion during 2017/18 to US$424.5  billion (about 8 months of prospective imports of goods and services) in March 2018. The U.S.  dollar value of India’s non-oil merchandise exports expanded by 12 percent in calendar year  2017, a 6-year high, helping to raise India’s global export market share somewhat. Nonetheless,  India’s export market share remains low, indicating a need to boost competitiveness through  structural measures.  
6. Systemic macro-financial risks bear monitoring, nonetheless, as the weak credit cycle  could impair growth and the sovereign-bank nexus has created vulnerabilities.  
· Bank credit growth recovered to 12.5 percent (y/y) in May. Incremental credit was mostly  allocated to households and the services sector, with credit to industry remaining stagnant. The  corporate sector has been deleveraging slowly and, while debt repayment capacity and  profitability appear to have bottomed out, they remain weak in aggregate. The recent fraud at a  large public sector bank (PSB) highlights governance weaknesses which have depressed bank  share prices. 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7 
INDIA  
· The RBI’s Asset Quality Review (AQR), initiated in 2015, improved recognition of non-performing  assets (NPAs), especially in PSBs, which account for about 70 percent of the banking system’s  assets. So far, 11 PSBs have been put under the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework that  became effective in April 2017. Meanwhile, system-wide capital adequacy has continued to  improve and remains above the minimum requirements. Nevertheless, PSBs continue to report  low profitability, high NPAs, and increased provisioning, related to the reclassification of their  loan portfolios, which remains a constraint on credit expansion and investment. As a result, the  NPA ratio for the total banking sector increased to 11.6 percent in March 2018 compared to  9.6 percent a year ago, in large part reflecting the migration of restructured loans to NPAs and  in line with the RBI’s new framework for the restructuring of stressed assets (see ¶31). A plan to  recapitalize PSBs, announced in October 2017, will add at least 0.8 percent of GDP to public debt  (financed through recapitalization bonds; Box 3). Depressed valuations may make it difficult to  meet the government’s expectation that PSBs raise an additional 0.3 percent of GDP from the  market over two years.2

· Financial markets were generally robust through early 2018—especially equities. Market  sentiment, however, has deteriorated in recent months, in line with increased global volatility.  Moreover, 10-year bond yields rose by 130 basis points in the nine months through early-March,  despite Moody’s upgrade of India’s government bond rating in November for the first time  since 2004. This reflects concerns of higher global yields, that the center and state fiscal targets  would be missed, and that some PSBs need to reduce holdings of government securities due to  mark-to-market losses—further highlighting the bank-sovereign debt nexus. In recent months,  yields have been particularly volatile given countervailing forces—announcements regarding the  debt issuance calendar for the new fiscal year showing backloaded issuance and easing foreign  investment limits for borrowings have been more than offset by global factors, including rising  U.S. interest rates and higher oil prices.  
7. India has been affected by the emerging market turmoil since mid-April. Portfolio  outflows from India were relatively large, triggered by the runup in international oil prices and  tighter global financial conditions, as well as domestic concerns over fiscal slippages and the

banking system’s exposure to the sovereign. In the ten weeks since April 13, net portfolio outflows  amounted to US$9.3 billion or about 0.3 percent of GDP, and pressures from significant capital  outflows were absorbed through the rupee depreciating by about four percent vis-à-vis the U.S.  dollar. Nevertheless, this episode of capital reversal has been less intense than the 2013 Taper  Tantrum, thanks to India’s stability-oriented policies and progress with structural reforms in recent  years. From mid-April to mid-June 2018, foreign exchange reserves fell by about US$16 billion (from  US$426 billion), and the RBI accelerated the scaling back of its net forward foreign exchange  position, which has been ongoing since September 2017. Following the sizeable purchases of  foreign exchange in the spot and forward markets in 2017 to contain rupee appreciation, the recent  declines in the central bank’s reserves and net forward position underscore the two-way nature of  India’s exchange rate management.  
8. The macroeconomic outlook for FY2018/19 is broadly favorable, even when considering  the recent upward revision to global oil prices and tightening of global financial conditions (Text  Table 1)3.  
· Real GDP growth is projected at 7.3 percent, on strengthening investment and robust private  consumption. Compared to the Spring WEO projections, growth will be somewhat lower  reflecting adverse terms of trade leading to real income losses to households and firms, and  additional effects from an incremental further tightening of monetary policy.  
· Headline inflation is projected to rise to 5.2 percent, above the mid-point of the RBI’s medium 
term inflation target band (4  percent CPI inflation ± 2 percent),  as demand conditions tighten,  along with higher oil prices,  housing rent allowances (HRAs),  and agricultural minimum support  prices (MSPs), and the recent  depreciation of the rupee. The  effect of these factors was visible  in recent inflation prints.

· The CAD is projected to widen to 2.6 percent of GDP on rising oil prices and strong demand for  imports, offset by a slight increase in remittances. The balance of payments would switch to a  small deficit.  
9. Over the medium-term, the economic outlook is projected to continue to improve.  Real GDP growth is expected to rise to 7¾ percent reflecting continued robustness in private  consumption and a recovery in investment, supplemented by progress in bank balance-sheet repair,  improved credit growth, and on-going structural reforms, most notably the productivity-enhancing

effects of GST. Beyond potential fiscal gains, the national GST lowered internal trade barriers and will  help create a common domestic market. This potential growth rate is estimated to be 0.5  percentage points lower than in the last Article IV consultation, due to a somewhat slower-than previously-envisaged impact of structural reform, along with a downward revision to the historical  GDP times series (Box 4).  
10. Beyond the risk of a further increase in international oil prices, other risks are also  tilted to the downside (Appendix II). Domestic risks pertain to tax revenue shortfalls related to  continued GST implementation issues. Delays in addressing the twin balance sheet problems may  lead to a further deterioration of the balance sheets of banks and corporates. Slow progress in  implementing key structural reforms could weigh on investor sentiment, investment, and growth. On  the external side, further tightening of global financial conditions could intensify the recent reversal of capital flows and add to external borrowing costs. A retreat from cross-border integration  including spillover risks from a global trade conflict could affect exports. Nonetheless, given India’s  relatively low trade openness, spillover risks of a global trade conflict are likely contained, to the  extent that it does not affect capital flows. India’s outward spillovers are likely limited to its  neighboring economies, namely Nepal and Bhutan, given trade ties and their currency pegs to the  Indian rupee.  
Authorities’ Views 
11. The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment of the outlook and risks.  They expected that the economic recovery would continue to strengthen and be broad-based, as  agricultural output improves on the back of a predicted normal monsoon, industrial output expands  in line with growing domestic and external demand, and services sector growth remains robust. The  authorities observed a strong pickup in credit from banks and other financing sources to the  commercial sector compared to last year. With improving capacity utilization and credit uptake,  investment activity is expected to remain robust even as there has been some tightening of  financing conditions in recent months. They also highlighted a significant rise in infrastructure  investment, particularly in road construction, with the government’s focus on demand and job  creation through spending on rural and labor-intensive infrastructure likely to support rural demand.  They underscored that risks to near-term growth persist, mainly arising from volatile oil prices and  tightening global financial conditions. On inflation, the authorities indicated that their projections  were lower than staff’s. They also emphasized the need to look through the statistical impact of the  HRA (0.35 percentage point on headline inflation) and cautioned that only the second-round impact  would be relevant from a policy perspective. Moreover, they saw substantial uncertainty regarding  the inflationary impact of higher MSPs, pending the operationalization of the mechanism to set and  pay the higher prices.

KEY POLICY ISSUES  
12. Policy mix. With limited policy space, growing risks (which places a premium on prudent  policies), and the economy recovering, India would be served best by stepping up supply-side  measures to revive credit growth (including to businesses) and promote inclusive growth. Fiscal  consolidation should continue to lower elevated public debt levels and allow for easing of financial  repression. The RBI will need to gradually tighten policy further, in response to inflation pressures,  which will help to build monetary policy credibility. The staff’s advice on financial sector reforms is  anchored by the recommendations made in the recent FSAP (Appendix III).  
13. Macro-financial and structural policies are medium-term priorities to boost inclusive  growth and harness the demographic dividend. Immediate priorities are to revive bank credit and  enhance the efficiency of credit provision by accelerating the cleanup of bank and corporate balance  sheets and a decisive strengthening of PSB governance. Gains can also be made by simplifying and  streamlining the GST structure and broadening the tax base. More broadly, over the longer term,  greater labor market flexibility, land reforms, and product market liberalization are needed.  
A. Fiscal Policy—Enhancing Sustainability  
14. Fiscal consolidation paused in FY2017/18 as the planned reduction in the central  government deficit target did not materialize, partly reflecting one-off factors (Text Table 2).  The central government deficit remained  
at the FY2016/17 outturn of 3.5 percent of  GDP (authorities’ presentation; provisional  accounts) and above the budget target of  
3.2 percent of GDP. The deficit is estimated  to have deteriorated by 0.3 percent of GDP  relative to FY2016/17 in the IMF  
presentation.4 Relative to the FY2016/17  outturn as a share of GDP, non-tax  revenue declined sharply, offset partly by a  small increase in tax revenue and a  reduction in expenditures, mainly lower  capital spending. Lower-than-budgeted

15. The central government’s FY 2018/19 budget again envisages a reduction in the  headline fiscal deficit.  
· The authorities’ presentation shows a reduction of about 0.2 percent of GDP, while the IMF  projects a reduction of 0.4 percent of GDP (0.3 percent of potential GDP in cyclically-adjusted  terms).  
· Net revenues are budgeted to increase as a share of GDP, roughly half from an increase in direct  tax collections. Continued base-broadening and enforcement measures would boost personal  income taxes (PIT), offset by a slight fall in corporate income taxes (CIT) following a modest tax  rate cut for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Indirect tax revenue is  budgeted to rise mainly on improved GST compliance. Non-tax revenue is projected to increase  slightly, while other tax revenues are set for a small decline, with an increase in the states’ share  from gross revenues. The budget introduced a long-term capital gains tax on equities at a 10  percent rate, raised custom duties on several items, and lowered excise rates on petrol and  diesel. Pressures may mount on cutting back excises on fuel as retail prices have risen recently.  
· Expenditures are budgeted to increase as a  share of GDP, primarily reflecting higher  subsidy payments, offset by lower interest  expenses. A key government initiative  launched in the context of the budget  remains unfunded, namely to offer farmers a  MSP of 1.5 times production cost. The budget  also announced the launch of a flagship  national healthcare scheme to cover 500

percent of GDP, financed mostly off-budget).  
16. The government accepted the medium-term fiscal targets recommended by the Fiscal  Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Review Committee but with a delayed  timetable. The recommendation to set-up a fiscal council was not approved.  
· The fiscal deficit, adopted as the operational target, will be reduced to 3.0 percent of GDP  (authorities’ definition) by FY2020/21, two years later than the first year of meeting the target as  recommended by the FRBM Review Committee.  
· Central government debt will be brought down to 40 percent of GDP by FY2024/25, two years  later than recommended.  
12 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA  
17. Staff supports the FY2018/19 budget targets, and the authorities should stand ready  to take corrective measures if there are any slippages.  
· India has limited fiscal space as debt is close to thresholds that increase the likelihood of debt  distress among emerging market economies (Appendix IV). High interest burden and risks from  rising yields necessitate continued focus on debt reduction, to enable establishing policy  credibility, building buffers, and further reducing the statutory liquidity requirement (SLR).  
· The states' share in aggregate fiscal deficits and debt is large, and spending pressures pose risks,  including from farm loan repayment waivers, the UDAY scheme under which states take over  part of electricity distribution companies' debts and losses in return for reforms, and the  recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission. While states' fiscal deficits have generally  been within 3 percent of GDP, stipulated under states' self-imposed fiscal rules, they have risen  recently even as the center has consolidated.  
· Against the backdrop of a narrowing output gap, the FY2018/19 budget targets imply a  reduction of the cyclically-adjusted deficit as noted earlier (IMF presentation). However, revenue  risks, mainly from GST, and expenditure risks may limit the adjustment.  
· Vigilance is needed in view of the higher-than-usual uncertainty surrounding GST revenue  projections, stemming mainly from the absence of historical data on which to base projections.  In the context of GST adoption, the center has guaranteed states’ annual revenue growth of 14  percent for a period of 5 years. Therefore, GST revenue slippages could exacerbate the central  government deficit through additional transfers to states and necessitate further fiscal measures.  
· Enhancing GST compliance, including by streamlining filing and refund mechanisms and  simplifying the rate structure, along with strengthening tax administration, are key to relieve the  burden on MSMEs and help deliver on the GST’s promise of enhanced formalization of  economic activity. Fewer rates and a broader base would limit opportunities for reclassification  (to exploit rates differences between inputs and outputs) and simplify administration. In this  context, consideration could be given to include petroleum products in the GST.  
· On the expenditure side, the government primarily needs to limit the fiscal cost of the proposed  increase in MSPs and avoid increasing fuel subsidies (or alternatively reducing fuel excise taxes).  In addition, rising interest rates could put pressure on the government’s interest burden.  
18. Staff recommends a more ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation path than  currently envisaged by the authorities. The center has consolidated over the last few years from  high deficit levels. The expected acceleration of growth provides room for a more rapid reduction in  the deficit and would allow the authorities to adopt a consolidation path consistent with the FRBM  Review Committee’s recommendation to reduce general government debt to 60 percent of GDP by  FY2022/23, underpinned by further reforms to subsidies and continued measures to raise tax  buoyancy (Text Table 3; the footnotes therein provide details on the measures underpinning the  alternative scenario). This entails a cumulative improvement in the cyclically-adjusted primary 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13 
INDIA  
balance of about 1.3 percent of potential GDP over 4 years, well below consolidations achieved by  other countries (the top quartile of achieved adjustments is 3 percent over 3 years). A faster pace of  consolidation would help cap the rise in long-term bond yields, reduce external and banking  vulnerabilities, and improve market confidence.  
19. Staff assessed the growth impact of a more ambitious fiscal-consolidation scenario  using the IMF’s Flexible System of Global Models (FSGM). This was done for the two  components of the consolidation—a reduction in government expenditure (subsidies) and an  increase in tax revenues. The limited growth impact reflects the gradual nature of the consolidation,  the use of relatively less distortionary fiscal instruments, and monetary policy being assumed to ease  relative to the baseline to moderate the impact on domestic demand—such a scenario represents a  relatively growth-friendly consolidation.

3/This scenario illustrates achieving the FRBM committee's recommendation that general government debt be reduced to  60 percent of GDP by FY2022/23. This is achieved with a combination of greater tax buoyancy and subsidy cuts. (A) Tax  buoyancy assumptions are: CIT = 1.1, PIT = 1.1, GST = 1.15 (relative to broadly neutral buoyancy in the baseline),  assuming continued base-broadening measures. GST is assumed to achieve buoyancy sufficient to raise GST to GDP ratio  by around 0.5 percentage points over 5 years (in line with the median increase in central government Value Added Tax  over 5 years in cross-country panel of 69 countries). (B) Subsidies are reduced gradually by 0.5 percent of GDP over 4  years, with a 0.3 percent of GDP cut in fertilizer subsidies, elimination of fuel subsidies, and a modest cut to food  
20. Staff encourages the authorities to upgrade the fiscal-reporting framework. With states  responsible for an increasing share of spending, maintaining fiscal discipline and strengthening  macro-fiscal capacity at the state level is essential. This includes harmonizing state budgetary  processes and decreasing the more-than-one-year lag in reporting fiscal data. The recently  appointed 15th Finance Commission will address several state issues, for which IMF staff is providing  background on international experiences and best practices related to subnational governments,  including through SARTTAC (Appendix V). Additionally, to capture risks stemming from off-budget  spending (which appear to have risen), coverage of expenditures should be broadened. These  improvements would allow enhanced coverage of the general government’s fiscal position. 
14 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA  
Authorities’ Views  
21. The authorities agreed on the need to take corrective measures in the event of  slippages to the FY2018/19 budget targets. With the economy improving, they believed that any  fresh slippages are likely to be moderate. They were confident that the GST would be buoyant over  the near term, adding up to ½ percent of GDP in revenues in each of the next two years. The GST  was also expected to help boost direct taxes, through improved compliance and record-keeping.  The recently introduced e-way bill, an electronically-generated document which is required to be  generated for inter-state goods transactions above INR 50,000 (approximately US$750) in value  would significantly help improve GST compliance. Further reforms to the GST would first focus on  base broadening before considering further rationalization of the rate structure, although the  pruning of the list of items subject to the top 28 percent tax rate had already effectively led to some  rationalization. Regarding base broadening, the authorities noted that taxing certain fuels such as  aviation fuel and natural gas under the GST would be relatively easy, but including other products  such as petrol, diesel, and immovable property would be more challenging as they were key revenue  sources for states. In the Indian context, pruning exemptions would also be difficult. On the  expenditure side, the recent public financial management (PFM) reforms including advancing the  budget calendar, reducing subsidy leakages through Direct Benefit Transfers (DBTs), and reducing  project cost overruns had helped improve expenditure control. The PFM System developed by the  Ministry of Finance is being implemented. It needs to be strengthened to improve the quality of  expenditure and fiscal data reporting.  
22. The authorities noted that the recommendations of the FRBM committee including a  formal debt anchor had been accepted by the government and amendments to the FRBM Act  had been passed through the Finance Act of 2018. While underscoring the importance of  medium-term fiscal consolidation, they felt that a gradual pace was called for because of the need  to support growth and development. A gradual pace was also deemed to be more feasible and  would avoid disappointments relative to a more ambitious path.  
23. Regarding the recording of bank recapitalization costs in the fiscal accounts, the  authorities noted that they had followed international best practice in pricing the  government’s bond-financed equity stakes in the PSBs. Market prices, as per the applicable  formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India regulations, were paid. Being  consistent with a preferred shareholder acquiring a large allotment of equity, the recapitalization  was recorded below the line as a financing transaction.  
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy—Consolidating Credibility  
24. Monetary policy tightening in early June was appropriate and further gradual  tightening will be needed. The policy rate had been on hold since August 2017 (6 percent). Staff’s  assessment is that after the June rate hike (to 6.25 percent), monetary policy conditions are broadly  neutral based on staff estimates of the natural rate of interest (about 1.45 percent) and one-year  ahead inflation expectations (4.8 percent). Headline and core inflation are rising and forecasted to 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15 
INDIA  
be above the mid-point of the headline  252896539498
inflation target band in the near and  
medium term, raising the probability  
that adverse shocks could push headline  
inflation above the RBI’s target range  
and calling for a tighter stance.  
Persistently elevated inflation could also  
lead expectations to become  
entrenched—household expectations  
were revised higher in the RBI’s latest  
survey. Inflation risks are tilted to the  
upside—including from higher oil prices,  
potential changes to MSPs, exchange  
rate depreciation, possible fiscal slippages, second-round effects from state-level increases in HRAs,  and recently-announced increased import duties. Tighter monetary policy will, however, make it  more challenging to revive the credit cycle.  
25. To enable the RBI to achieve the medium-term inflation target on a sustained basis  continued action to improve the monetary transmission mechanism is needed. Having  established a robust institutional framework for monetary policy, key next steps include enhancing  competition in the banking system, encouraging banks to streamline credit pricing, addressing  fragmentation of interbank markets, and continuing to enhance communication. Accordingly, PSB  governance reform and reducing the government’s footprint in the banking system would play an  important role in leveling the playing field, thereby promoting competition and market efficiency.  Important gains can be expected from addressing banks’ NPAs, operationalizing corporate debt  restructuring processes, and agriculture sector reforms to help stabilize food prices and contain  households’ inflation expectations.  
26. India’s external position is assessed to be broadly consistent with fundamentals and  desirable policy settings (Appendix VI). External debt at around 20 percent of GDP is moderate  compared to other emerging market economies. External financing looks sustainable, but could be  affected by domestic and external volatility. In the past year, a number of changes affecting FDI and  portfolio flows were implemented, largely moving in the general direction of capital account  liberalization. Further liberalization of portfolio inflows should be considered, while considering risks  of capital flows volatility. Gross reserves, at more than 160 percent and about 210 percent of the  standard and capital flow measures-adjusted IMF metrics at end FY2017/18, respectively, appear  adequate for precautionary purposes.  
27. India should continue to rely on exchange rate flexibility.  
· Experience in other fast-growing emerging market economies suggests that the real effective  appreciation of the rupee is mostly inevitable over the longer term. Overly restricting currency  appreciation would lead to opportunity and sterilization costs from foreign exchange  interventions and slow the development of the foreign exchange market, including for hedging 
16 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA  
instruments. Accordingly, interventions should be two-way and limited to disorderly market  conditions.  
· In the event of severe external pressures or further increases in oil prices, continued exchange  rate flexibility complemented by tighter fiscal and monetary policies would help ease the shock.  Based on the Debt Sustainability Analysis and FSAP stress tests, negative balance sheet effects  from a rupee depreciation would likely be contained.  
Authorities’ Views  
28. The authorities indicated that forward-looking monetary policy will continue to be  calibrated to achieve the medium-term inflation target. Considering inflation data available  through April 2018, at the time of the consultation mission, their forecast of headline inflation in  FY2018/19 was 4.6 percent, below that of staff, partly because the authorities had not yet factored in  the upside risks from higher MSPs, state HRAs, and possible fiscal slippages. The authorities noted  that monetary policy would look through the direct effect of the HRA, were confident that food  inflation in the medium term would remain subdued, and emphasized that headline inflation is the  official target. Although there was broad agreement with staff’s assessment of the output gap, the  authorities emphasized significant uncertainty around these estimates. The authorities agreed with  staff on the importance of continued supply-side reforms to contain food inflation and the need for  stability-oriented macroeconomic policies to help anchor inflation expectations.  
29. The authorities concurred that the external position is broadly consistent with  fundamentals and desirable policy settings. They agreed with the assessment of a CA norm  of -2.5 percent of GDP and felt strongly that a CAD above 3 percent of GDP may pose financing  difficulties. A more negative CA norm would also give the wrong signal for macroeconomic  management. The authorities confirmed that exchange rate flexibility would continue, but argued  for proactive rather than reactive intervention to prevent disorderly market conditions and noted  that intervention should be assessed across a full capital inflow-outflow cycle. They planned to  continue using foreign exchange interventions to smooth rupee movements and augment external  buffers during episodes of sustained inflows to be used during outflows, which tended to occur in  spurts.  
C. Financial and Corporate Sector—Addressing the Twin Balance Sheet  Problem  
30. A range of complementary initiatives has been taken to address India’s twin balance  sheet problem and resurrect PSB’s financial intermediation. In addition to the AQR, recognition  of NPAs, implementation of the new PCA framework, and PSB recapitalization, the RBI directed  banks to refer two batches of large corporate accounts in July and December 2017, representing  about 40 percent of PSBs’ outstanding NPAs by value, to the time-bound resolution process under  the IBC. Importantly, there is a sense that the implementation of the IBC could shift the power  balance between debtors and creditors and improve corporate repayment discipline. Five of the 12 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17 
INDIA  
accounts from the first batch are now resolved or nearing the final stages of resolution. Ongoing  efforts to build institutional capacity for the effective functioning of the IBC are welcome and could  be complemented with designing an out-of-court regime that offers a flexible, speedy, and low-cost  alternative to the in-court process under the IBC.  
31. In recent months, the RBI introduced a new, simplified framework for the resolution of  stressed assets. The new framework involves a more proactive approach in identification,  monitoring, and supervision of problem assets and their reference to the IBC process. Accordingly,  banks have begun to reclassify a large share of restructured loans (e.g., PSBs reduced these loans  from 2.7 percent in September 2017 to 1.1 percent of total loans in March 2018) as NPAs, pushing  up the NPA ratio further. The higher provisioning coverage (40 percent required for NPAs compared  to 5 percent for restructured loans) will cause weaker PSBs to continue to report losses in the  coming quarters.  
32. Staff welcomes the various initiatives but urges the authorities to further strengthen  governance and accelerate implementation as part of a broader package of financial reforms.  In addition to speeding up NPA resolution and completing PSB recapitalization, this includes  improving bank governance, reducing the role of the public sector in the financial system, and  enhancing bank lending capacity and practices, thereby reducing the fiscal contingency risks arising  from PSBs in the future.5 The Banking Reforms Roadmap, announced by the government in January  2018, indicates that the recapitalization will be contingent on measures to strengthen governance  and operations. However, the plans remain vague, and staff recommends that the authorities pursue  more far-reaching governance reforms, for instance removing the RBI representatives from banks’  boards and defining better the terms of reference for board members, including the Ministry of  Finance representative, to strengthen the quality and independence of banks’ boards. More  aggressive PSB disinvestment and privatization would address some of the structural issues in  governance, such as incentives and efficiency of PSBs.  
33. Promoting private-sector based alternatives to PSBs is needed over the medium term. The recent successful IPO of a private bank that had started out as a microfinance institution, the  vibrancy of India’s non-bank financial corporations, and the rapidly-developing fintech space  illustrate the viability of market-based solutions to India’s access-to-finance and financial-inclusion  challenges. The government should also continue to gradually reduce the SLR to help deepen  markets and encourage lending and reexamine priority sector lending (PSL) targets, which apply  equally to private banks. These targets distort resource allocation, result in contingent and actual  fiscal liabilities that have repeatedly been associated with PSBs, and lead to financial repression.  
34. Staff encourages the authorities to follow up on the FSAP recommendations, including  to amend the legal framework to provide the RBI full regulatory and supervisory powers over PSBs  
5 A panel was set up to study asset management companies to resolve the NPAs. The FSAP advised focusing on  further promoting private asset reconstruction companies, and recommended against establishing public ones given  the heterogeneity of cases, difficulties in setting transfer prices, challenges related to governance and expertise, and  the fact that the largest cases are already being addressed under the IBC. 
18 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA  
to make banking regulation and supervision ownership-neutral. The recent large fraud at Punjab  National Bank—the second largest PSB—underscores the importance of steps needed to improve  PSB governance and internal controls. At the same time, the strong growth of credit to households  from private banks and non-bank finance companies calls for vigilance on the part of RBI  supervisors, to make sure that these institutions uphold underwriting standards.  
Authorities’ Views  
35. The authorities agreed on the importance of focusing on the implementation of the  reforms. While acknowledging some initial teething problems in its operationalization, the  authorities expected the implementation of the IBC to contribute to the speeding up NPA  resolution. Accordingly, the banking sector’s NPA ratio was expected to peak within a year. Banks’  provisioning is improving, and early indications from some of the large cases subject to the IBC  process suggest that the provisioning requirements may be sufficient. For instance, lower-than provisioned haircuts in the steel industry—the largest contributor to overall NPAs—are expected to  release capital and support further credit growth. The authorities recognized the importance of the  PSB governance reform and reiterated that it is an integral part of the recapitalization plan with a  reporting framework in place to monitor progress. The RBI was reviewing supervisory processes and  frameworks to strengthen fraud prevention and assessment of operational risk. 
36. The authorities stressed the key role played by PSBs in the economy and argued for a  gradual pace of reducing the government’s presence in the financial sector. Although the PSL  requirements apply equally to private sector banks, PSBs are critical in providing financial access  more directly to underserved populations. The authorities are encouraging PSBs to diversify and  differentiate their business models, while improving risk management. The RBI has been  progressively reducing the SLR and it was noted that: (i) the ratio was currently not binding, with  banks maintaining SLRs well in excess of the requirement; and (ii) banks were allowed to use part of  their qualifying assets to satisfy the liquidity coverage ratio.  
D. Structural Reforms—Boosting Investment and Inclusive Growth  
37. To support inclusive growth, key structural challenges need to be resolved. Since the  1980s, wide-ranging structural reforms to deregulate, open, and make the economy more  competitive have contributed to vastly improved living standards, with the share of the population  in poverty decreasing significantly. However, income per capita remains relatively low, and income  disparities are widening. Moreover, unlike some other emerging market economies, India‘s  manufacturing sector remains relatively small, reflecting major rigidities in labor, land, and product  markets.  
38. Comprehensive reforms will help raise productivity and reduce vulnerabilities, setting  the stage for higher and more sustainable growth. Labor market reforms could complement the  GST in terms of promoting the formal economy and creating fiscal space for needed social and  infrastructure spending. Improving the business climate combined with trade liberalization would  also complement the GST in creating a more integrated, domestic market for goods and services, 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19 
INDIA  
linking India’s states also to the rest of the world. This, in turn, would reduce external vulnerabilities  and generate more stable sources of financing, supporting the fiscal position.  
39. The government continues to pursue growth-friendly policies, but the recent focus has  shifted to implementation of reforms that have been already initiated. Steps taken in recent  years continue to bear fruit. For example, on FDI liberalization, caps on foreign investments in  different sectors have been largely relaxed. The Foreign Investment Promotion Board, which was  responsible for clearing FDI proposals in cases where government approval was required, has  recently been abolished. Most foreign investments are now allowed to enter sectors of the Indian  economy under the automatic route. As a result, FDI inflows to India have been strong.  Nevertheless, progress in other areas has been more limited, particularly on further deregulating  labor markets and agricultural reforms.  
Trade Policy Issues  
40. Further trade liberalization and reforms to facilitate trade and investment will  ultimately benefit India, and expand its role in the world trade system. Trade barriers remain  significant.6 Trade documentation and procedures are cumbersome, and lengthy processing times  are burdensome. India’s average most favored nation applied tariff rate (at 13.4 percent as of 2016)  is higher than in some peer countries, though with relatively large differentiation between  agricultural and non-agricultural products. In addition, tariffs are being changed frequently,  including in the FY2018/19 budget. Trade in services is also restricted. Restrictions on foreign entry,  barriers to competition, and lack of regulatory transparency are reportedly the main obstacles.  Reducing non-tariff barriers, stabilizing and then subsequently decreasing tariffs, and implementing  supply-side reforms to improve the business climate would help increase India’s integration in  global markets. The recent liberalization of FDI policies is a positive step in this direction.  
41. Several trade-related issues concerning India are currently being considered at the  WTO. 
· The United States has challenged India’s export subsidy schemes at the WTO, as creating an  uneven playing field. India has recently crossed the income threshold, above which a country  becomes subject to the prohibition on export subsidies.  
· The United States questioned India’s methodology related to calculations of the market price  support for wheat and rice at the WTO Committee on Agriculture, raising concerns on possible  underreporting of the support’s size. 
· Following the announcement of the imposition of large steel and aluminum tariffs by the United  States on several countries’ imports, including for India, the Indian authorities sought  consultations on their consistency with the WTO norms. While a direct impact on India’s exports  
6 Trade barriers are documented in IMF WP 18/32 “A Multidimensional Approach to Trade Policy Indicators.” 
20 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA  
from the tariffs is likely to be relatively small, the authorities are concerned about their possible  impact on the global trade system.  
Labor Market Reforms  
42. An important priority is modernizing labor regulations and other measures to help  increase formal employment and employment of women. Analytical work on structural reform  priorities and sequencing, featured in the 2017 Article IV consultation, found that labor market  reforms are the top priority since they maximize gains while minimizing short-run costs, given  India’s large informal sector. With growth recovering and greater progress in product market  reforms, now is the time to shift attention to labor market reforms. Notwithstanding the recent  extension of fixed-term labor contracts to all sectors, labor laws remain numerous, outdated, and  restrictive, including at the sub-national level. Staff’s analytical work highlights the linkage between  labor market rigidities and misallocation of resources in manufacturing. By providing disincentives  for firms to hire more and expand, these rigidities stifle productivity growth and formal sector job  creation.  
43. Further labor reforms will help reap the full benefits of the demographic dividend and  economies of scale from the national GST. Reforms to the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947 and  restrictive clauses under the Factories Act of 1948, including reforms to job protection for  permanent workers, are key to enhance labor market flexibility and allow firms to expand and reach  economies of scale. Labor laws, which currently number around 250 including both the center and  states, need to be streamlined and reduced, building on current efforts to rationalize the various  laws into four Labor Codes. Labor market rigidities push down female labor force participation,  which is among the lowest in peer countries.7  
Infrastructure and Product Market Reforms  
44. More emphasis could be put on addressing delays in infrastructure investment. In  recent years, the supply side of the economy has been strengthened through large investments in  airports, roads, telecom, and power generation. Nevertheless, there is a general recognition that  sustainably higher growth will require more action on addressing infrastructure bottlenecks. India’s  Project Monitoring Group (PMG) has been empowered to speed up investment approvals, but many  projects are still pending PMG approval. The most common delays include environmental clearances  and land acquisition issues.  
45. Land reforms remain essential to facilitate and expedite infrastructure development.  Staff welcomes recent initiatives and schemes to overcome project delays (e.g., Engineering,  Procurement, and Construction schemes and the setting up of Special Purpose Vehicles to acquire  land and obtain relevant permits and licenses) and transfer risks to the entity that is most capable of  handling it (e.g., procedural and administrative risks related to land acquisition to the government  and construction and commercial risks to the private sector). Nevertheless, efforts should be  
7 See the Selected Issues Paper prepared for the 2017 Article IV Consultation. 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21 
INDIA  
enhanced on land reforms to streamline and expedite land acquisition and simplification of  procedures.  
46. Continued actions to strengthen further the business climate are important. Despite  recent simplification efforts, business regulations remain very complex, litigation lengthy, and  corruption and bureaucracy reportedly major obstacles for doing business. Further steps could  include contract enforcement and judicial reform. In addition, measures to reduce administrative  and regulatory burdens, improve governance, shorten regulatory approval timelines, and widen  implementation of single-window clearance can support foreign and domestic investments.  
47. Sustained inclusive growth requires agricultural sector reforms, as productivity in the  sector remains low. The staff’s analytical work highlights the importance of reducing supply-side  constraints, building more integrated markets, boosting productivity, and addressing market  distortions. As MSPs could skew farmers’ production decisions, add to inflation, and enlarge the  fiscal burden, their use (backed by assured procurement) should only be temporary and limited to  correcting market failures. Farmers should be supported through other reforms. Despite gradual  implementation, recent agricultural policy initiatives such as the assured irrigation system, the  introduction of common electronic trading platform for the National Agriculture Market (e-NAM)  and the development of Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAM) are welcome and promise to reduce  production risk, increase competitiveness, and improve transparency in state agricultural markets.  Building on recent progress, more needs to be done to revamp government procurement processes  and the public distribution system (PDS) for food, including to restructure the role of the Food  Corporation of India via outsourcing of cereal procurement and stocking operations as well as  checking leakages in the PDS. Various agricultural subsidies are being streamlined especially  through DBTs, and should be further reduced going forward.  
Authorities’ Views  
48. The authorities generally recognized the need for further comprehensive structural  reforms to make the Indian economy more competitive. They underscored the strong pick-up in  infrastructure investment activities through the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund in  recent years, which should also help attract more FDI flows into India’s infrastructure sector. While  acknowledging that steps need to be taken to further improve the business climate, the authorities  pointed at India’s substantial advances in recent years in cross-country rankings regarding the ease  of doing business, thanks to the government’s sustained efforts on regulatory reforms. They pointed  to ongoing reform efforts at the state level to improve the ease of doing business, thus generating  reform momentum through competition among states and setting best practices. On labor reform,  the authorities argued that the recent extension of fixed-term labor contracts to all sectors should  bring sufficient flexibility. They were also hopeful that recently-announced plans to increase the  coverage of healthcare and new welfare provisions which cover the informal sector and enhanced  paid maternity leave should improve female labor force participation. The authorities noted that the  agricultural sector reforms are underway, including to streamline agricultural subsidies through the  application of DBT and to build nationally-integrated agricultural markets through e-NAM and  GrAM. 
22 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA  
49. The authorities expressed strong support for the multilateral rules-based trade system  but had some reservations on staff’s call for trade reforms. The authorities noted their strong  support for the WTO dispute resolution mechanism and were concerned about a possible reversal of  global trade integration. On trade tariffs, rates have been gradually decreasing on average, and  recent increases for some goods were consistent with India’s WTO commitments and were effected  in response to developments in the domestic economy. In this context, the authorities noted that  India’s tariff rates were not substantially higher than in peer countries with similar income levels.  They also objected to the OECD’s services trade restrictiveness indicator on methodology and  results. Regarding export subsidy schemes, the authorities believe that an eight-year transition  period should be applied for unwinding those schemes.  
STAFF APPRAISAL  
50. Following transitory disruptions, India is again one of the world’s fastest-growing  economies. Cash shortages in the aftermath of demonetization and transitional costs related to the  introduction of the national GST exacerbated a growth slowdown in FY2017/18 that had started  earlier. But activity picked up in recent quarters with robust contributions from private consumption  and gross fixed capital formation. As a result, inflation is now on the rise after moderating to a  multi-year low earlier on subdued demand, low food prices, and currency appreciation.  
51. Growth is projected to recover in FY2018/19 and strengthen in FY2019/20 as stability oriented macroeconomic policies and progress on structural reforms continue to bear fruit. India  stands to benefit from further implementation of key structural reforms to spur the country’s catch  up with advanced economies, including the inflation-targeting monetary policy framework, the IBC,  the GST, and steps to liberalize FDI flows and improve the ease of doing business.  
52. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Rising international oil prices will hold  back activity. Beyond further oil price increases, other risks derive from tighter global financial  conditions, a retreat from cross-border integration including spillover risks from a global trade  conflict, and rising regional geopolitical tensions. Domestic risks pertain to tax revenue shortfalls  related to continued GST implementation issues and delays in addressing the twin balance sheet  problems and other structural reforms.  
53. The policy mix should be geared to supply-side measures to promote inclusive growth.  With the economy recovering, the output gap closing, and inflation rising, policy space is limited,  suggesting a premium on prudent macroeconomic policies.  
54. Continued fiscal consolidation is needed to lower elevated public debt levels and allow  for easing of financial repression. India has limited fiscal space as debt is close to thresholds that  increase the likelihood of debt distress among emerging market economies. Accordingly, the  immediate focus should be on achieving the ambitious revenue targets which underlie the  FY2018/19 budget targets, while standing ready to take corrective measures if risks to revenues,  mainly from the GST, and expenditures materialize. Enhancing GST compliance, including by  streamlining filing and refund mechanisms and simplifying the rate structure, are key to relieve the 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 23 
INDIA  
burden on smaller businesses and help deliver on the GST’s promise of formalizing economic  activity.  
55. The authorities should adopt a more ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation path  and look to upgrade the fiscal reporting framework. The expected acceleration of growth  provides room for faster deficit reduction, allowing the authorities to adopt a consolidation path  consistent with the FRBM Review Committee’s 60 percent of GDP general government debt target  by FY2022/23. In the context of efforts to strengthen macro-fiscal capacity at the state level as well  as the work of the recently appointed 15th Finance Commission, state budgetary processes should  be harmonized and fiscal-data reporting made timelier. In addition, coverage of expenditures should  be broadened to allow for enhanced reporting on the general government’s fiscal position and  capture risks stemming from off-budget spending.  
56. The recent tightening of monetary policy was appropriate and further gradual  tightening will be needed. With the output gap closing, inflation rising and forecasted to be above  the mid-point of the target band in the near and medium term, and inflation risks on the upside,  further tightening would anchor expectations and build monetary policy credibility. To enable the  RBI to achieve the medium-term inflation target on a sustained basis, continued action is needed to  improve the monetary transmission mechanism. In this regard, PSB governance reform and reducing  the government’s footprint in the banking system can be expected to help promote competition  and market efficiency.  
57. A key focus of the authorities should be on macro-financial and structural policies to  boost investment, jobs, and productivity, and thus inclusive growth over the medium term to  harness India’s demographic dividend. Despite wide-ranging reforms in recent decades, income per  capita remains relatively low, and income disparities are widening including among the states.  
58. More progress is needed in tackling the twin balance sheet problem and resurrecting  PSBs’ effective financial intermediation. The simplified framework for the resolution of stressed  assets announced by the RBI in February rounds off earlier steps to recognize NPAs, promote a  time-bound resolution process under the IBC, and recapitalize the PSBs. Implementation of these  pillars needs to be accelerated and backed by a comprehensive plan to improve PSB governance,  internal controls, and operations to reduce fiscal contingency risk, including by considering more  aggressive disinvestment and privatization. The authorities are also encouraged to follow up on the  FSAP recommendations, including to amend the legal framework to provide the RBI full regulatory  and supervisory powers over PSBs and make banking regulation and supervision ownership-neutral.  
59. India would benefit from further liberalization of trade and reforms to facilitate trade  and investment. India’s capital flow management framework is moving in the general direction of  capital account liberalization. Most FDI is now allowed to enter sectors of the Indian economy under  the automatic route, but there is scope to reduce administrative and regulatory burdens and  improve governance. Further liberalization in portfolio flows could be considered, while remaining  vigilant to risks of capital flow reversals. As a strong advocate of the multilateral rules-based trade  system, India is encouraged to play a bigger role in the world trade system. 
24 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA  
60. India’s external position is assessed to be broadly consistent with fundamentals and  desirable policy settings, with international reserves adequate for precautionary purposes.  Exchange rate flexibility should continue, with foreign exchange intervention being two-way and  limited to disorderly market conditions.  
61. Modernizing labor regulations and other measures to help increase formal  employment and employment of women is a priority. In view also of India’s low female labor  force participation, further modernizing labor laws would encourage productivity growth and formal  sector job creation, as well as reduce labor market rigidities that push down labor force  participation, and allow India to reap the full benefits from the new national GST.  
62. Achieving sustainably higher inclusive growth will require addressing infrastructure  bottlenecks and agricultural sector reforms. In recent years, important progress has been made in  strengthening the supply side of the economy through large infrastructure investments.  Notwithstanding new initiatives and schemes to overcome project delays, land reforms remain  essential to facilitate and expedite infrastructure development. Similarly, the initiatives to build more  integrated markets and address market distortions will raise productivity in the agricultural sector by  reducing production risk, increase competitiveness, and improve transparency in state agricultural  markets.  
63. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12- month cycle.

Box 1. Demonetization and its Aftermath  
A surprise announcement in November 2016 to withdraw 87 percent of currency in circulation introduced an acute  monetary shock, exacerbating the growth slowdown that had started earlier. To date, remonetization is largely  complete and growth is recovering. Despite increased digitization, more needs to be done to make sustained gains in  reducing the informal economy. Tax compliance has improved somewhat, also aided by GST implementation.  
Remonetization is largely completed. The RBI collected 99 percent of the cancelled notes. Currency in circulation  has risen above pre-demonetization level and appears to be growing slightly faster than the pre-demonetization  trend.

1/ The growth forecast considered the negative growth impact of demonetization and was based on the  old GDP series.  
2/ The current growth forecast is based on the new GDP series and factored in the negative growth impacts  from demonetization and GST implementation. 
The abrupt money supply shock due to cash shortages exacerbated the growth slowdown: · Uncertainty and disruptive cash shortages put a damper on consumer and business sentiment. As a result, high frequency indicators for consumption (e.g., sales of two-wheelers) and production (e.g., industrial production,  manufacturing and services PMI, and production of cement) saw strong declines. These indicators suggest that  the effect of demonetization largely ended by May 2017.  
· The impact on growth appears to have been more severe and longer-lasting than anticipated at the time of the  2017 Article IV consultation with a disproportionate impact on the informal sector. Considering the national  accounts revisions starting in the first quarter of 2017/18, growth slowed steadily by about 180 basis points  
from the announcement of demonetization to May 2017, compared to about 100 basis points projected in the  previous Article IV staff report. The uncertainty created by the implementation of the GST likely prolonged the  growth slowdown.  
Demonetization’s digitalization and formalization objectives remain a work in progress. One objective of the  demonetization exercise was to drive consumers and businesses away from cash-based transactions in the  informal economy. Digital and formal channels of  3153128399172
transactions did rise and should help raise tax compliance  
and formalize the economy:  
· Digitization. Electronic payments rose considerably in  
the immediate aftermath of demonetization and then  
fell somewhat but appear to be on an increasing trend.  
· Tax compliance. Efforts are being made to identify and  
legitimize the source of deposits made in the months  
after demonetization, complemented by a campaign  
against tax evasion. As a result, the Indian Ministry of  
Finance estimates that the growth of new taxpayers  
reached 45.3 percent in FY2016/17, compared to 25.1 percent in the previous fiscal year.

Sources: Haver Analytics and IMF staff calculations. 
While the GST sets a uniform tax rate across states, other elements of the GST structure are less  streamlined than recommended. Uniform tax rates across states is a major achievement. Nevertheless, the  GST in India includes four non-zero tax rate tiers (and additional rates and cesses for specific goods) and a  broad array of exemptions such as on alcohol and petroleum, which goes against Fund advice of having as  few tax rate tiers as possible and minimal exemptions.  
As the new regime normalizes, high frequency indicators point to a recovery from the third quarter of  FY2017/18. With GST implementation issues being addressed and businesses and consumers adjusting to  the new system, short-term supply- and demand-side indicators rebounded strongly, and growth recovered  to 7.2 percent (y/y) in the third quarter of FY2017/18. Medium-term growth is expected to improve owing to  efficiency gains from the GST that improve intra-Indian trade in goods and services.

Box 3. PSB Recapitalization Plan  
The Government of India (GOI) is undertaking a significant recapitalization of PSBs to enhance  regulatory capital and provide “growth capital” to boost lending to the economy. The two-year  
recapitalization plan of INR 2.1 trillion (1.3 percent of  GDP) was initially announced in October 2017. A  subsequent announcement in January 2018 detailed  the allocation of 0.5 percent of GDP to 20 PSBs during  FY17/18, 59 percent of which was slated for 11 weak  PSBs currently under the RBI’s PCA framework. The  bulk of the recapitalization in the first year was  financed by recapitalization bonds. The total capital  injection envisaged is broadly in line with the capital  needs estimated by the 2017 FSAP, which ranged from  0.75 to 1.5 percent of GDP.

The Banking Reforms Roadmap, announced alongside the recapitalization, lacked details on  measures to improve PSB governance and operations. The roadmap lists six “reform themes”, including  strengthening PSBs; increasing credit supply; and deepening financial inclusion and digitalization. Measures  to strengthen PSBs include more rigorous underwriting and loan loss recovery practices and rationalization  of non-core assets and overseas operations. Bank boards are tasked with approving the plans for  implementing the reform agenda and monitoring their progress. The government indicated that the  recapitalization will be contingent on reform progress, without specifying the milestones to be met for each  tranche.  
The plan’s impact on banks’ credit provision is unclear and implementation delays have been costly.  · The sizable recapitalization is a positive development, but further analysis is needed to assess  how much capital could be directed to increasing lending. Much will depend on the capital  needs from the ongoing NPA resolution  
proceedings and their implications for  the sufficiency of provisioning. Other  160

Box 4. Potential Output  
Potential growth for India is increasing  
gradually, and is estimated at 7.3 percent  28330295967
in FY 2017/18. Estimates are derived from a  
combination of statistical and multivariate  
filters. A production-function decomposition  
of the potential-growth estimates indicates  
that much of the recent acceleration is due to  
improvements in total factor productivity  
(TFP) growth, which have more than offset a  
dwindling contribution from the physical  
capital-stock, attributable to the prolonged  
period of subdued investment growth.  
Positive impacts of ongoing reforms will likely boost potential growth to around  7¾ percent over the medium-term.1/ The most notable contribution comes from the  
introduction of the GST. Despite its  complicated structure, efficiency gains are  anticipated to increase internal trade and  boost growth in coming years.2/ There  remains considerable scope for potential  output to increase even further—above 8  percent—though important additional  reforms in the areas of land and labor, which  could generate a rebound in investment,  would be needed, along with simplifying and

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The  relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a  probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level  
of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term (ST)” and “medium  term (MT)” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Appendix IV. Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis  
India’s debt is high, but favorable debt dynamics and financial repression make the debt path  sustainable. Risks are further mitigated because public debt is denominated in domestic currency  and predominantly held by residents. The statutory liquidity requirement creates a captive domestic  market for debt which limits the interest cost of debt. Under the baseline, the public debt-to-GDP  ratio would decline from 70 percent in 2017/18 to 63 percent of GDP by 2022/23, while gross  financing needs would decline from about 12 percent to 9 percent of GDP. The primary risk to debt  sustainability stems from shocks to real GDP growth and fiscal slippages. India’s external debt at  about 20 percent of GDP remains sustainable.  
1. India’s debt-to-GDP ratio is high at around 70 percent of GDP. Over the medium term debt is projected to decline to around 63 percent of GDP driven by favorable debt  dynamics. Nominal GDP growth is projected to increase from 10 percent to around 12 percent  over the medium term and effective interest rates are projected to remain close to 8 percent.  Inflation over the medium term is forecast to be stable around 4 percent. India’s debt-stabilizing  primary deficit is calculated at 2.5 percent of GDP, and the primary deficit in the baseline  assumptions is nearly one percent of GDP lower than that over the medium term.  
2. India’s public debt sustainability analysis is based on the following macroeconomic  assumptions: 
· Growth assumptions. Real GDP growth is estimated to have bottomed out after the dual  shocks of demonetization and disruptions from GST implementation. Growth was 6.7 percent  in 2017/18 and is projected to increase to 7.3 percent in 2018/19 and gradually to 7¾  percent in the medium term. Robust growth will be driven by a moderate pickup in  investment and increases in intra-Indian trade because of efficiency gains from the GST. The  medium-term growth forecast has been revised downward compared to the last DSA  because of a GST structure that was more complicated than anticipated and limited progress  on land and labor reforms which are needed for a sustained rise in investment and a further  acceleration in growth, along with a downward revision to historical growth.  
· Fiscal Assumptions. The central government fiscal deficit deteriorated in 2017/18 relative to  2016/17 (IMF presentation), as non-tax revenue declined sharply, offset partly by a small  increase in tax revenue and a reduction in expenditures, mainly lower capital spending. In the  IMF’s presentation the deterioration amounted to 0.3 percent of GDP. The government is set  to resume consolidation with a planned reduction in the general government deficit by 0.4  percent of GDP (IMF presentation) in the 2018/19 budget. The consolidation is predicated on  higher revenues due to base broadening effects and increased GST compliance.  
3. Fiscal Risks.  
· The center has committed to fill the gap potentially arising from GST-related revenue  shortfalls in states. Specifically, the center has guaranteed states’ annual revenue growth at  14 percent for a period of 5 years from the implementation of GST. Because of this, GST 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 53 
INDIA  
revenue slippages would affect the central government budget through higher transfers to  the states.  
· State fiscal deficits have broadly been within the 3 percent limit recommended by the 14th Finance Commission. However, risks remain and stem from announcements of farm loan  waivers in several states, the implementation of the 17th Pay Commission (underway), and the  taking on of losses from electricity generation corporations as stipulated in the UDAY  scheme. Assessing these risks is complicated by the more-than-one-year lag in the  availability of data on states’ fiscal positions.  
· The government recently announced a plan to recapitalize public sector banks over two  years. The recapitalization will add at least 0.8 percent of GDP to the public debt. This is  included in the baseline. The size of the recapitalization is in line with recommendations from  the last FSSA. Further recapitalization needs are not anticipated, but the contingent liability  shock is included to account for a financing need equivalent to 1 percent of GDP.  
4. India’s debt profile is conducive to debt stability. Nearly 95 percent of debt has a long  and medium-term maturity, and debt is largely held by residents. Foreign currency-denominated  debt is negligible. The composition of debt is set to remain the same over the projection period  with the bulk of financing needs met by the issuance of medium and long-term debt  denominated in domestic currency and held by residents. The interest bill is substantial with  gross financing needs equivalent to nearly 12 percent of GDP. As fiscal consolidation resumes,  these needs will decline by around 3 percent of GDP over the medium term. The statutory  liquidity requirement creates a captive domestic market for debt which limits the interest cost of  debt.  
5. Projections over the medium term are reasonable according to the assessment in  the template. Assumptions on fiscal consolidation are within the median for surveillance  countries and are expected to be met. Past forecast errors in projecting real GDP growth and the  primary balance are reasonable with a percentile rank around 50 percent for each. The team’s  forecast of inflation has been better than the median for other surveillance countries.  
6. The primary risk to India’s debt sustainability is low growth, though the risks  remain contained. The stress test corresponding to a growth shock yields a deteriorating debt  path with debt-to-GDP reaching a peak of 71 percent of GDP and gross financing needs reaching  a peak of 12 percent of GDP. The combined macro-fiscal shock yields slightly worse outcomes  though the debt path would return to a downward trajectory.  
7. Elevated vulnerabilities in the heat map stem from a high baseline debt-to-GDP  ratio. Since debt-to-GDP is slightly above 70 percent, the baseline threshold is breached and the  heat map for the debt level is red. Gross financing needs are below the 15 percent of GDP  threshold and do not deteriorate in shock scenarios. Risks stemming from market perception  (measured by EMBI global spreads) and external financing requirements (defined as the current  account balance and amortization of short term external debt) are limited.

1/ The cell is highlighted in green if debt burden benchmark of 70% is not exceeded under the specific shock or baseline, yellow if exceeded under specific shock but not  baseline, red if benchmark is exceeded under baseline, white if stress test is not relevant. 
2/ The cell is highlighted in green if gross financing needs benchmark of 15% is not exceeded under the specific shock or baseline, yellow if exceeded under specific shock  but not baseline, red if benchmark is exceeded under baseline, white if stress test is not relevant. 
3/ The cell is highlighted in green if country value is less than the lower risk-assessment benchmark, red if country value exceeds the upper risk-assessment benchmark,  yellow if country value is between the lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks. If data are unavailable or indicator is not relevant, cell is white.  Lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks are: 
200 and 600 basis points for bond spreads; 5 and 15 percent of GDP for external financing requirement; 0.5 and 1 percent for change in the share of short-term debt; 15  and 45 percent for the public debt held by non-residents; and 20 and 60 percent for the share of foreign-currency denominated debt. 4/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds, an average over the last 3 months, 13-Dec-17 through 13-Mar-18. 
5/ External financing requirement is defined as the sum of current account deficit, amortization of medium and long-term total external debt, and short-term total external  debt at the end of previous period.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks.  Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being  presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.  
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is  used to project debt dynamics five years ahead. 
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account balance. 4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2010.

 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 61  
INDIA  
Appendix V. Recent and Planned IMF Capacity Development  
1. The Fund’s capacity development (CD) activities with India have been scaled up in  recent years. IMF technical assistance (TA) and training have supported the authorities’ efforts to  enhance the formulation and implementation of sound macroeconomic and financial policies as well  as build institutions and capacity. Examples include the introduction of the inflation targeting  framework, banking sector stress testing, the modernization of the insolvency regime, the design of  the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the fiscal responsibility framework, and the strengthening of  macroeconomic statistics.  
2. Upon its inauguration in February 2017, the South Asia Regional Training and  Technical Assistance Center (SARTTAC) has become the focal point for the delivery of IMF CD  services to India and South Asian countries. In FY2018, SARTTAC extensively provided training  and TA in the Fund’s core areas of expertise such as training on national accounts (June 2017,  November 2017, and April 2018), BOP/IIP statistics (July 2017), strengthening budget institutions  (September 2017), public financial management (June 2017), and a government finance statistics  workshop (September 2017), as well as a course on managing capital flows (September 2017). To  date, 235 Indian officials received training through SARTTAC.  
3. In line with the Fund’s CD strategy,  
· Recent activities and collaboration with Indian authorities has improved targeting to  country needs. At the request of the 15th Finance Commission, APD and FAD have planned  a pipeline of TA missions to provide the Fund’s analysis and assistance in developing  approaches to handle issues on fiscal federalism. These issues include assisting on  constraints on state budgets, achieving vertical fiscal balance, and incentivizing greater fiscal  discipline among states, including through market discipline. In addition, an APD/SARTTAC  monetary policy workshop is being planned to provide a forum for knowledge sharing on  evolving monetary policy frameworks in India, Nepal, and Bhutan.  
· CD activities have been further integrated with surveillance and IMF policy advice.  Based on FSAP recommendations, LEG has conducted a workshop jointly with the Insolvency  and Bankruptcy Board of India to discuss practical and operational challenges faced under  the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy regime, including insolvency of enterprise groups and  cross-border insolvency. SARTTAC has also started working bilaterally with the Reserve Bank  of India (RBI), with possible workshops and TA on the accounting of NPLs under the IFRS  and an early warning exercise. A customized training on External Sector Assessment was  delivered for the RBI in October 2017. This will support IMF surveillance on exchange rate  assessments. Statistics TA in various areas provided through both SARTTAC and IMF  headquarters is benefiting surveillance and supports the authorities’ CD needs.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:  
The exchange rate in India is classified as floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined in  the interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes at times. The RBI’s role is to  modulate excessive volatility so as to maintain orderly conditions. On August 20, 1994, India  accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement. India  maintains the following restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current  international transactions, which are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a):  restrictions related to the nontransferability of balances under the India-Russia debt agreement;  restrictions arising from unsettled balances under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with  two Eastern European countries; and a restriction on the transfer of amortization payments on loans  by non-resident relatives. The Executive Board has not approved these restrictions.  
Article IV Consultation:  
The previous Article IV consultation discussions were held in November 2016. The Staff Report (IMF  Country Report No. 17/54) and associated Selected Issues (IMF Country Report No. 17/55) were  discussed by the Executive Board on January 25, 2017.  
FSAP Participation:  
Concluding meetings for the latest FSAP Update were held in Delhi and Mumbai in July 2017—the  FSSA Update report was published in December 2017 (Country Report No. 17/390). A Detailed  Assessment of Observance of the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision was issued  in January 2018 and published as Country Reports No. 18/4.  
Capacity Development (Technical Assistance and Training):  
Recent and planned IMF capacity development and training activities with India are discussed in  Appendix V of the staff report.  
Resident Representative:  
A resident representative’s office was opened in November 1991. Mr. Andreas Bauer has been the  Senior Resident Representative since August 2016.

INDIA 
STATISTICAL ISSUES  
1. General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, weaknesses remain  in the timeliness and coverage of certain statistical series. India has an intricate system for compiling  economic and financial statistics and produces a vast quantity of data covering most sectors of the  economy. India subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) on  December 27, 1996 and started posting its metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board  on October 30, 1997. It is currently in observance of the SDDS, although it uses flexibility options for  timeliness of data on general government operations and on the periodicity and timeliness of labor  market data. The data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, IMF  Country Report No. 04/96) was published in April 2004. It assesses India’s data dissemination  practices against the SDDS requirements and assesses the quality of six datasets based on the Data  Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) developed by the IMF’s Statistics Department (STA).  
2. National accounts and employment statistics: In January 2015 the Central Statistical  Office (CSO) released a new series of national accounts, with base year 2011/12. In addition to the  shift in the base year for measuring growth, the revisions reflected a review of source data and  compilation methods, and implementation of the 2008 System of National Accounts. For current  price estimates, the data sources provide adequate coverage of economic activities, and the  methodology is broadly consistent with international standards and best practices. Nonetheless, a  sales-tax-based extrapolation of trade turnover value from the base year does not provide an  accurate gauge of growth of economy-wide value added from trade. The supply-side data are  deemed to be of better quality than expenditure-side data. There are still some weaknesses in the  deflation method used to derive value added. Also, the compilation of constant price GDP deviate  from the conceptual requirements of the national accounts, in part due to the use of the Wholesale  Price Index (WPI) as a deflator for many economic activities. The appropriate price to deflate GDP by  type of activity is the Producer Price Index (PPI), which is under development. Large revisions to  historical series, the relatively short time span of the revised series, and major discrepancies between  GDP by activity and GDP by expenditure complicate analysis. There are long-standing deficiencies in  employment data: they only cover the formal sector, which accounts for a small segment of the  labor market, and are available only with a substantial lag.  
3. Price statistics: A revised all-India Consumer Price Index (CPI) with new weights was  released in early 2011, which covers combined rural and urban India, with 2009/10 as a base year. As  well, separate corresponding urban and rural CPI series are published. The CPIs are published with a  lag of about one month. In early 2015, the CPI weights were updated using 2011/12 expenditure  data and the CPI series has been revised from January 2015. Since January 2006, the Labour Bureau  has published a CPI for industrial workers with a 2001 base year. Presently, there also remain four  CPIs, each based on the consumption basket of a narrow category of consumers (namely industrial  workers, urban and non-manual employees, agricultural laborers, and rural laborers). With the  exception of the industrial workers’ CPI, these other indices are based on weights that are over ten  years old. The WPI has been rebased to the 2011/12 base year. The authorities are in the process of  developing a PPI to replace the WPI. A new RBI price series on residential property price indexes 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5 
INDIA 
have helped surveillance in this area, though geographic coverage remains limited, and price data  for commercial real estate are not available. The RBI has started producing a series covering rural  wage data, which helps surveillance, but economy-wide wage data are scant.  
4. Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) is responsible for compiling  and disseminating the Government Financial Statistics (GFS). India reports annual Budgetary Central  Government data to STA. India disseminates the budgetary central government cash flow statement  within one month after the reference month and stock of liabilities within one quarter after the  reference quarter. Data on fiscal performance at the state level are available only at annual  frequency and with a considerable lag. Data on the functional and economic classification of  expenditures are available with considerable lag. There is also scope to improve the analytical  usefulness of the presentation of the fiscal accounts. For example, classification of government  expenditure between developmental/nondevelopmental and plan/nonplan obscures the economic  nature and impact of fiscal actions. The MoF reports central government data (on a cash basis) for  publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, the latest reported data corresponding to  2013. India reports GFS for Budgetary Central Government infrequently. The latest data reported to  STA are for 2016, but due to the series’ break these data are still not published. Data on the general  government operations are not internationally comparable as they exclude data on the operations  of the extra-budgetary funds, local governments, and social security funds. Under the SDDS, India  disseminates annual general government data within 3 quarters after the reference year, using the  timeliness flexibility option. India meets the SDDS specifications for central government debt and  operations.  
5. Monetary and financial statistics: The RBI web site and the RBI Bulletin publish a wide  array of monetary and financial statistics, including reserve money and its components, the RBI’s  survey, the monetary survey, liquidity aggregates (outstanding amounts), interest rates, exchange  rates, foreign reserves, and results of government securities auctions. In 2011, the RBI started  publishing a weighted-average lending interest rate and other lending rates at annual frequency.  The frequency and quality of data dissemination have improved substantially in recent years.  
6. The RBI reports monetary data to STA with substantial delays and in non-standard format.  The RBI also provides ""test"" data using the standardized reporting forms. However, the test data do  not contain sufficient details (e.g., instrument, currency and counterparty sector breakdowns) to  construct a complete and analytically useful picture of India’s financial sector that is also consistent  with the guidelines provided in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. In addition, data  reported cover depository corporations only, and data on other financial corporations such as  insurance corporations, pension funds, and investment funds are not covered.  
7. Financial sector statistics: As for reporting of financial soundness indicators (FSIs), all 12  core and 11 encouraged FSIs for deposit takers as well as three FSIs for real estate markets are  reported on a quarterly basis. FSIs for other financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations, and  households are not reported. 
6 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 
8. External sector statistics: The concepts and definitions used to compile balance of  payments statistics are broadly in line with the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and  International Investment Position Manual (BPM6). However, trade data have valuation, timing, and  coverage problems. Data on imports of goods in the balance of payments are registered in c.i.f.  prices while the BPM6 requires the f.o.b. pricing. Data on trade in goods prices, volumes, and  composition are not regularly available on a timely basis. External debt statistics are available on a  quarterly basis with a one quarter lag. Estimates of short-term external debt are presented on an  original maturity basis. The short-term maturity attribution on a residual maturity basis is only  available annually (and excludes residual maturity of medium- and long-term nonresident Indian  accounts). The international investment position (IIP) statistics cover the sectors prescribed in the  BPM6 and these data are disseminated within three months of the reference period in respect of  quarterly data.1 Coverage of direct investment positions data is hampered by the absence of  appropriate legal or institutional authority. India disseminates monthly the Data Template on  International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity as prescribed under the SDDS. More  up-to-date information on certain variables, such as total foreign reserve assets, foreign currency  assets, gold, and SDRs, are available on a weekly basis and are disseminated as part of a weekly  statistical supplement on the RBI web site.  
1 The IIP as published by the RBI values equity liabilities at acquisition cost, while the Fund uses market prices,  resulting in substantial differences.

Statement by Subir Gokarn, Executive Director for India  
and Himanshu Joshi, Senior Advisor to Executive Director  
July 18, 2018  
1. We thank the IMF India Mission team for their constructive engagement with our authorities  during their visit to India and their excellent staff note and Selected Issues Papers. Our authorities  broadly agree with the thrust of their analysis and recommendations. However, there are a few  differences in views, which are pointed out in the relevant sections of this Buff statement. 
Growth and Inflation  
2. India is one of the fastest growing major economies in the world. GDP grew by 8.2 per cent in  2015-16 and 7.1 per cent in 2016-17. Growth in 2017-18 is estimated at 6.7 percent. The prolonged  slowdown in global growth, subdued investments and stressed balance sheets of the banking and  corporate sectors have impacted India’s efforts to achieve its growth potential. Despite these  challenges, growth has accelerated. The economy grew at 7.7 per cent in Q4 of 2017-18 – the  fastest pace in the last seven quarters. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) growth has  accelerated for three consecutive quarters up to Q4 of 2017-18 and capacity utilization by  manufacturing firms increased significantly of late. Credit growth has been accelerating and has  reached 12.8 per cent year-on-year as on June 22, 2018 as against 5.6 per cent a year ago. Total  flow of resources, including those from non-bank sources, had increased to 27.4 per cent in 2017- 18. Overall, despite higher oil prices, India’s GDP growth outlook for 2018-19 remains positive  and growth is expected to be broadly in line with the IMF staff projection of 7.3 per cent.  
3. In view of the rising inflationary trend seen in recent months, the policy (repo) rate was  increased to 6.25 per cent in June 2018 to preserve a neutral stance. For 2018-19 the Reserve Bank  of India has projected CPI inflation at 4.8-4.9 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2 with risks tilted  to the upside. However, proactive food supply management by the Government and RBI’s  inflation targeting framework are well positioned to contain unwarranted building-up inflationary  risks. Going forward, our authorities will continue to strengthen efforts to achieve the medium term target of headline inflation of 4 percent on a durable basis.  
The Fiscal Situation  
4. The government is committed to fiscal prudence. The central government finances have  achieved substantial consolidation since 2013-14, helped by buoyancy in tax revenues and  rationalization of subsidies. The gross fiscal deficit (GFD) was brought down to 3.5 per cent in  2016-17 without sacrificing public investment needs and social sector spending. Though 3.2  percent GFD was budgeted for FY 2017-18, this has been revised upwards to 3.5 percent. The  government has budgeted a lower order of GFD of 3.3 percent for FY 2018-19. Further, the  government has resolved to achieve a target of 3 percent GFD by 2020-21.  
5. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) system introduced with effect from July 01, 2017 has  reformed the system of indirect taxes of goods and services in one stroke. By subsuming a plethora  of central and state level indirect taxes, the GST has simplified and streamlined payments and  credits and enhanced the efficiency of inter-state movement of goods. Needless to mention, the  implementation of a far-reaching reform like the GST has been complex and painstaking process 
2  
in a large country like India. As the tax collection goes up, the capacity to rationalize the slabs and  the rates, also will certainly increase. Therefore, these capacities will increase once the total  volume of tax collected significantly increases. Also, this tax system will ensure that evasion  doesn't take place. Our authorities believe that with the robust implied buoyancy of GST of 1.2, the  tax proceeds could be expected to add up to ½ percent of GDP in revenues in each of the next two  years. The positive spinoffs from the GST system have enabled bringing a large part of the  unorganized sector within the fold of indirect tax system. Our authorities strongly object to the  report’s reference to domestic risks pertaining to tax revenue shortfalls related to continued GST  implementation issues. We would like to emphasize that the disappearance of the initial policy  inertia over time will ensure that the future revenue stream from GST is more regular and  predictable and not subject to these risks.  
6. On the expenditure front, the implementation of public financial management system has  strengthened expenditure management, with granular reporting of expenditures. Funds leave the  consolidated account only when matched to needs. While the linkage of AADHAR unique identity  numbers to Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) have reduced leakages substantially, the government is  incentivizing states for their effort to reduce the outgo on subsidies. Reduction in project cost  overruns have further helped to tighten expenditure controls. We differ with staff’s views on  overshooting of central government’s budget deficit owing to transfers to states on account of  GST. We reiterate that such transfers are essentially fiscally neutral.  
The External Sector  
7. In recent years, India’s external sector has benefited from lower current account deficit (CAD),  robust foreign direct investments (FDI) inflows, build-up of reserves and improvement in other  vulnerability indicators. India’s foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 405.8 billion as of July 6,  2018. The CAD to GDP ratio was 0.7 per cent in 2016-17. The CAD ratio increased to 1.9 percent  for FY 2017-18.  
8. India’s exchange rate interventions are meant to prevent disorderly market conditions. Under  normal market circumstances, the exchange rate can move flexibly in line with evolving market  developments.  
9. On the trade front, India is committed to a free and fair international trade system. Although  India recently crossed the income threshold for prohibition of subsidies, the Government is of the  view that an 8-year transition period should be applicable for unwinding subsidy schemes as was  earlier permitted to countries that crossed the said income threshold in 1994 when the WTO’s  Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Agreement was implemented. Our authorities are deeply  concerned about a possible reversal of global trade integration. Following the announcement of the  imposition of large steel and aluminum tariffs by the United States, the Indian authorities sought  consultations on their consistency with the WTO norms. India is concerned about the compounded  effect of actions that may be triggered by these tariffs e.g. safeguard actions initiated by the EU on  domestic industry and its possible adverse impact on the global trade system. Moreover, selective  exemptions potentially undermine the MFN/ non-discrimination principle. The average MFN  applied rate for India for all commodities was 13.1 per cent in 2016. However, for non-agricultural  commodities, the applied MFN rate was lower at 9.8 per cent in 2016. By these yardsticks, India’s 
3  
tariffs are not substantially higher than those of its peer countries, given that it is still at a relatively  lower level of economic development. The bound rates have been negotiated based on the level of  economic development of the country and the tariffs are well within these bound rates. Besides  tariff changes are infrequent and certain changes within the bound rates should not be construed as  ‘frequent’ modifications in tariffs, as has been mentioned in staff report.  
10. India has taken several reforms to liberalize services trade. Thus, the assessment of  restrictiveness based on the figures using OECD Services Trade Restrictiveness Index (STRI) and  the World Bank (WB) STRI may not be appropriate given India’s serious objections to the  methodology and construction of the STRI, which portrays India as being excessively restrictive  despite several reforms. It may also be underscored that while the STRI does not consider several  reforms undertaken by India to liberalize services trade, the areas in which the developed  countries’ regime is most restrictive, e.g., Mode 4, are not reckoned in the calculus of the STRI.  Finally, India’s FDI regime, which includes investment in services, has been significantly  liberalized, with 100 percent FDI being allowed under the automatic route in several sectors. The  staff report’s reference to statement about restrictions on foreign entry, barriers to competition and  lack of regulatory transparency as the main obstacles are unsubstantiated by facts and we object to  this characterization of the trade regime in India.  
11. Most sectors have been brought under automatic approvals route for foreign investments and  caps in different sectors have also been largely relaxed. With the successful implementation of e filing and online processing of FDI applications, the approval system based on a single window  system for FDI has been put in place. The system of inter-ministerial joint quarterly reviews of  FDI proposals enable quick processing of foreign investments request. The continuing thrust on  liberalization in recent years has given India the unique status of the most open economy in the  world for FDI. The UNCTAD’s survey of multinational enterprises ranked India as the third most  favorite host country for FDI for 2017-19 after the US and China. Gross FDI inflows during FY  2017-18 stood at US$ 60.97 billion compared with US$ 60.22 billion in the previous year, US$  55.56 billion in 2015-16 and US $ 45.15 billion in 2014-15.  
12. The initiatives taken towards ease of doing business have started to bear fruit as can be seen  from the World Bank Doing Business (DB) Report, 2018 (released in October 2017), which  ranked India 100 among 190 countries, registering a leap of 30 ranks over its previous rank of 130  in the Doing Business Report 2017. A single window portal has been established for receiving FDI  applications that require Government approval. The applicants can file online applications on this  portal, which are then electronically transferred to the concerned Administrative  Ministry/Department. The present system has been functioning smoothly since its inception and  average time taken to process the FDI applications has reduced significantly.  
The Financial Sector  
13. The financial sector is undergoing transformation with a focus on resolution of stressed assets  in the banking system, the legal framework for insolvency resolution has been reinforced with the  enactment of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016 and amendments made to the  Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest  (SARFAESI) and Debt Recovery Tribunal Acts. The IBC 2016 provides for a market-determined, 
4  
time-bound process for orderly resolution of insolvency, and ease of exit, wherever required. Rules  governing voluntary corporate liquidation have since been established by the Insolvency and  Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) responsible for implementation of IBC 2016. The National  Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) - the  arbitration and appellate frameworks - are already functional and have established operational  processes for complete resolution of cases brought before them. The implementation of the IBC  will contribute to the speeding up of the NPA resolution.  
14. Banks’ provisioning is improving, and early indications from some of the large cases subject  to the IBC process suggest that the provisioning requirements may be sufficient. To mitigate  further build-up of balance sheets risks, smaller public sector banks (PSBs) have been advised to  reduce their corporate loan exposures by a minimum of 15 per cent by March 2019 and put in  place board-approved policies to ensure appropriate loan exposure mix. Meanwhile the Financial  Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill 2017 (FRDI Bill), has been introduced in the Indian  Parliament. The Bill envisages constitution of Resolution Corporation to protect consumers of  financial service providers from financial distress. The FRDI Bill will complement the IBC, and  together, they will provide a comprehensive resolution framework for the entire economy. Our  authorities are committed to governance reforms in PSBs and are monitoring the progress through  a reporting framework. In fact, governance reforms and action plans to enhance operational  efficiency and customer services are integral to the recapitalization package provided to the PSBs.  
Agriculture and the Rural Economy  
15. Emphasis on the implementation of rural roads program, rural electrification and affordable  housing projects have added depth to growth and employment. Continuing the thrust on agriculture  and rural sector, the central budget 2018-19 increased allocation for creation of livelihoods and  rural infrastructure with an objective to provide maximum opportunities in the rural areas by  substantially ramping up spending on agriculture and allied activities and construction of irrigation  and other rural infrastructure. In the absence of fair marketing infrastructure, the Minimum  Support Price (MSP) system has played an important role in supporting the farmer incomes  through fair realization of their produce. The government has initiated measures to double farmers’  incomes by 2022 through price support measures, better marketing infrastructure, thrust on exports  and enhanced private investments. An Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund is proposed to be set up to  develop and upgrade agricultural marketing infrastructure in rural agricultural markets. However,  given the wide disparity in nutritional status among the people, the state’s role in procurement and  distribution of foodgrains to identified beneficiaries will remain significant for supply management  and inflation control.  
Infrastructure  
16. To facilitate international as well as domestic funding in infrastructure, the National  Infrastructure and Investment Fund (NIIF) was formed. The objective of NIIF is to attract equity  capital from both international and domestic sources for infrastructure investments in  commercially viable projects, both greenfield and brownfield, and stalled projects. It will operate  with the highest standards of governance, and keep in mind the need to balance transparency and  confidentiality among stakeholders and partners. The NIIF Ltd. plans to partner with leading "

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2017 Article IV Consultation with India 
On January 25, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded  the Article IV consultation1 with India. 
The Indian economy has recorded strong growth in recent years, helped by a large terms of trade  gain, positive policy actions including implementation of key structural reforms, a return to  normal monsoon rainfall, and reduced external vulnerabilities. Inflation has remained low after  the collapse in global commodity prices, a range of supply-side measures, and a relatively tight  monetary stance. Fiscal consolidation at the Union government level resumed in FY2016/17, and  has been complemented by measures to enhance the quality of public spending. External  vulnerabilities are in check, with the current account deficit expected to remain compressed and  international reserves standing at US$360 billion as of late-December 2016 (around 8 months of  import cover). Persistently-high household inflation expectations and large fiscal deficits remain key  macroeconomic challenges, which limit policy space for supporting growth through demand  measures. Furthermore, excess capacity in key industrial sectors and strains in financial and  corporate sector balance sheets remain a drag on private investment, and weak external demand  continues to constrain India’s exports.  
The post-November 8, 2016 cash shortages and payment disruptions caused by the currency  exchange initiative have undermined consumption and business activity, posing a new challenge  to sustaining the growth momentum. Growth is projected to slow to 6.6 percent in FY2016/17,  then rebound to 7.2 percent in FY2017/18, due to temporary disruptions, primarily to private  consumption, caused by cash shortages. Tailwinds from a favorable monsoon, low oil prices and  continued progress in resolving supply-side bottlenecks, as well as robust consumer confidence, will support near-term growth as cash shortages ease. The investment recovery is expected to  remain modest and uneven across sectors, as deleveraging takes place and industrial capacity  utilization picks up. With temporary demand disruptions and increased monsoon-driven food  supplies, inflation is expected at about 4.75 percent by early 2017—in line with the Reserve  Bank of India’s inflation target of 5 percent by March 2017. Supply-side reforms, particularly in  
1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually  every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials  the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which  forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. 
agriculture, continued fiscal consolidation, and relieving impediments to monetary transmission  are crucial to retain low inflation in the medium term. The current account deficit is expected  widen to about 2 percent of GDP over the medium term as domestic demand strengthens further  and commodity prices gradually rebound. The FY2016/17 Union Budget deficit target of 3.5  percent of GDP (equivalent to 3.8 percent of GDP in IMF terms) will likely be achieved.  Continued progress in reforms bodes well for a marked improvement in medium-term prospects,  with the adoption of the Goods and Services Tax poised to raise India’s medium-term GDP  growth to above 8 percent. 
Economic risks are tilted to the downside. On the external side, despite the reduced imbalances  and strengthened reserve buffers, the impact from global financial market volatility could be  disruptive, including from U.S. monetary policy normalization or weaker-than-expected global  growth. In the absence of disruptive global financial volatility, slower growth in China, Europe  and the United States would have only modest adverse spillovers to India, given weak trade  linkages. A key domestic risk stems from the government’s currency exchange initiative, where  the near-term adverse economic impact of accompanying cash shortages remains difficult to  gauge, while it may have a positive economic impact in the medium term. Domestic risks also  flow from a potential further deterioration of corporate and public bank balance sheets, as well as  setbacks in the reform process, including in GST design and implementation, which could weigh  on domestic demand-driven growth and undermine investor and consumer sentiment. On the  upside, larger than expected gains from GST and further structural reforms could lead to  significantly stronger growth; while a sustained period of continued-low global energy prices  would also be very beneficial to India. 
Executive Board Assessment2 
Executive Directors noted India’s strong economic performance of the past few years and  commended the authorities for their strong policy actions, including continued fiscal  consolidation and an anti-inflationary monetary policy, which have underpinned macroeconomic  stability. Directors recommended continued vigilance to potential domestic and external shocks,  and urged the authorities to further advance economic and structural reforms to address supply  bottlenecks, raise potential output, create jobs, and ensure inclusive growth. 
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to clamp down on illicit financial flows, but noted the  strains that have emerged from the currency exchange initiative. They called for action to  quickly restore the availability of cash to avoid further payment disruptions, and encouraged  prudent monitoring of the potential side-effects of the initiative on financial stability and growth.  
2 At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of  Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers  used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
Directors acknowledged the authorities’ strong policy push for cleaning up bank balance sheets  and welcomed legislation establishing the new bankruptcy code. Nonetheless, they noted that  elevated corporate sector risks and heightened levels of non-performing assets in public sector  banks continue to pose risks to banks’ soundness. Directors emphasized the importance of  augmenting capital buffers and continued governance reform of these banks, strengthening the  resolution regime for distressed bank assets by augmenting the capacity of newly established  mechanisms, and further measures to develop corporate debt markets, as key to enhancing the  financial system’s ability to contribute to growth. 
Directors welcomed the completion of the institutional foundation of India’s flexible inflation  targeting regime, in particular the formation of the Monetary Policy Committee. Directors agreed  that given sticky and elevated household inflation expectations and food supply constraints,  continued vigilance on upside risks to inflation is needed. Directors recommended that the  Reserve Bank of India stand ready to raise the policy rate should inflationary pressures gather  pace. They also stressed the importance of continued agricultural reforms aimed at boosting food  supplies as well as maintaining fiscal adjustment to support monetary policy in achieving low  and stable inflation. Directors noted that India’s international reserves are assessed to be  adequate, and emphasized that the flexible exchange rate should continue to act as a key shock  absorber. 
Directors emphasized that continued fiscal consolidation is critical to bring down the ratio of  public debt to GDP. They noted that fiscal consolidation will enable a gradual phasing-out of  financial repression, which will help price stability and lower the cost of credit for the private  sector, and rebuild space for counter-cyclical policy responses in the future. Implementation of a  
robust goods and services tax, given its growth enhancing effects, and further subsidy reforms,  should be key pillars of the authorities’ fiscal consolidation strategy. Directors encouraged the  authorities to build on the fuel subsidy reforms and advances in financial inclusion to implement  better targeting and more efficient delivery of the remaining subsidies and social spending  programs.  
Directors welcomed the authorities’ strong progress on structural reforms, and encouraged them  to prioritize labor market reforms at both the center and state levels. They also urged continued  efforts to reduce poverty and inequality, increase female labor force participation, and make  further efforts to improve financial inclusion. They noted the importance of further trade  liberalization and enhancing the business environment to help boost exports and attract greater  FDI flows.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2017 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION  
 January 6, 2017 
KEY ISSUES  
Context. The Indian economy has recorded strong growth in recent years, helped by a large  terms of trade gain, positive policy actions including implementation of key structural reforms,  a return to normal monsoon rainfall, and reduced external vulnerabilities. Inflation has  remained low after the collapse in global commodity prices, a range of supply-side measures,  and a relatively tight monetary stance. Key macroeconomic challenges include persistently high household inflation expectations and large fiscal deficits, which limit policy space for  supporting growth through demand measures. Supply bottlenecks and structural  impediments are the main constraints to medium-term growth and job creation.  
Outlook and Risks. Cash shortages arising from the currency exchange initiative have weakened  the near-term outlook. Medium-term growth prospects have improved due to the  implementation of key reforms, loosening of supply-side bottlenecks, and appropriate fiscal and  monetary policies that enhance macroeconomic stability. Risks are tilted to the downside, with  key external risks arising from intensified global financial volatility and slower global growth.  Key domestic risks include longer-than-anticipated cash shortages from the currency  exchange initiative and further weakening of bank and corporate balance sheets. Low-for longer global oil prices and greater investor confidence due to reforms are upside risks.  
Strategy. Action is needed to quickly restore cash in circulation and avoid payment disruptions.  Looking beyond this immediate challenge, policies should aim to reduce banking and corporate  vulnerabilities, durably lower sticky inflation expectations, continue fiscal consolidation, and  maintain the strong reform effort. Key elements:  
· Safeguarding financial stability, given elevated corporate and banking sector strains by:  ensuring full recognition of non-performing assets on banks’ balance sheets;  strengthening public banks’ loss-absorbing buffers; implementing further public banking  sector structural reforms; and enhancing banks’ debt recovery mechanisms. 
· Achieving durable disinflation. Real interest rates remain consistent with achieving the  inflation target of 5 percent CPI inflation by March 2017. Given medium-term upside risks  to food and CPI inflation, the authorities should stand ready to raise the policy rate if  inflationary pressures gather pace. 
· Continuing with fiscal consolidation. The FY2015/16 Union Budget achieved its deficit  target of 3.9 percent of GDP (authorities’ definition), and the FY2016/17 Budget is on track  to reach the smaller deficit target of 3.5 percent of GDP. Further reductions in subsidies  and tax reforms, including implementation of the recently-approved GST, are needed to  achieve fiscal consolidation plans over the medium term.  
· Maintaining the strong reform effort. Significant progress has been made in passing the  pan-India GST constitutional amendment, introducing a new bankruptcy code, using  Aadhaar identification and bank accounts to make direct benefit transfers, and enhancing  financial inclusion. Additional steps are needed to reduce supply bottlenecks, enhance the  efficiency of labor and product markets, and pursue further agricultural sector reforms.

CONTEXT: A CONSUMPTION-LED RECOVERY  
1. The Indian economy has recorded a strong growth in the recent past. After bottoming at  5.6 percent real GDP growth in FY2012/13, the economy has been on a gradual cyclical recovery,  reaching 7.6 percent growth in FY2015/16.1 As a result of wide-ranging policies to correct  imbalances and build buffers after the 2013 taper tantrum, which improved macroeconomic  
fundamentals, and spurred robust capital inflows,  India’s external vulnerabilities are now in check.  11 
Since late 2014, a halving of global oil prices has

boosted economic activity in India, further  8 
improved the current account and fiscal positions,  7 
and lowered inflation.2 Over the past two years, a  6 
systematic tackling of supply-side bottlenecks and

confidence and provided needed support to  2 
growth and macroeconomic stability.

2. Growth has been led by consumption, while investment growth has been weak. Supported by a large and durable terms of trade gain, and more recently by a favorable  agricultural crop outlook (supported by normal monsoon rainfall) and decennial civil servant wage  revisions, private consumption remains the driving force of the Indian growth recovery. However,  investment has contracted sharply in the first half of FY2016/17, reflecting excess capacity in key  industrial sectors and strains in financial and corporate sector balance sheets. The post-November  8, 2016 cash shortages and payment disruptions caused by the currency exchange initiative  (withdrawal of the legal tender of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, which accounted for 86 percent of  the value of currency in circulation, and introduction of new Rs 500 and Rs 2000 notes) have  strained consumption and business activity, posing a new challenge to sustaining the growth

1 India’s Central Statistical Office released a new series of national accounts in January 2015, with base year 2011/12.  Methodological deficiencies of the revised national account statistics, as described in the 2016 Article IV Staff Report,  and the lack of back-casted historical GDP data, constrain a comparison of current growth with past growth.  
2 India’s terms of trade has improved significantly (jumping by 2<U+2153> percent in 2013/14, by 3½ percent in 2014/15  and by a further 7 percent in 2015/16), supporting output growth and raising real incomes.

momentum. External demand has weakened further, with the growth of import volumes of India’s  trading partners decelerating to 2½ percent in 2015 from 4½ percent in the previous year.  
3. Progress on important economic and structural reforms over the past year has been  impressive. Over the past year, big bang reforms, such as the legislation of a new bankruptcy  code, formalization of inflation targeting framework, and a milestone constitutional amendment  enabling implementation of the pan-India Goods and Services Tax (GST), have taken place  alongside continued steps implementing the gradualist reform agenda of the Bharatiya Janata  Party (BJP)-led government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi (see Annex I: Key Policy Actions).  Notwithstanding its majority in the lower house of the national parliament, the BJP does not have  control of the upper house, thus requiring consensus building for the passage of key legislation. As a result, securing passage of the GST constitutional amendment spanned several parliamentary  sessions and entailed compromise with regional parties.  
4. Past Fund advice and the authorities’ macroeconomic policies have been broadly  aligned. Consistent with Fund advice, fiscal consolidation at the Union government (central) level  resumed in FY2016/17, and has been complemented by measures to enhance the quality of public  spending. Excise duties on petrol and diesel have been raised further, and kerosene and fertilizer  subsidy reforms have been pursued. The stance of monetary policy in 2015–16 has been  maintained consistent with achieving the interim inflation targets along the RBI’s “glide path”, in  line with previous IMF advice. The passage of the Bankruptcy Act, enhancements to corporate  debt restructuring and bank governance, and measures to deepen domestic corporate bond  markets were also broadly in line with past IMF recommendations. The RBI has adopted a flexible  inflation targeting regime with a formal inflation target band (August 2016) and introduced a  statutory Monetary Policy Committee (September 2016). Progress on land, labor and agricultural  market reforms, however, has been limited. 
OUTLOOK AND RISKS  
5. The currency exchange initiative and its associated cash shortages are weighing  heavily on activity, and its impact on financial institutions should be monitored carefully. Given the dominance of cash in everyday transactions, the post-November 8, 2016 decreased  availability of cash and associated payment disruptions caused by the currency exchange initiative  have strained consumption and business activity and the operations of the financial system,  posing a new challenge to sustaining the growth momentum (see Box 1). The supply of new  banknotes in the first month following the initiative was insufficient, even as the authorities took  multiple steps to ease the currency transition. The November PMI for both manufacturing and  services declined sharply, reflecting a large drop in output and new orders components. While the  financial system is expected to weather the currency exchange-induced temporary growth  slowdown, the authorities should remain vigilant to risks—in view of the potential further build-up  of NPAs, including among private banks and elevated corporate sector vulnerabilities—and  ensure prudent support to the affected economic sectors. 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5  
INDIA 
6. The repercussions from India’s currency exchange initiative will likely persist  through the first quarter of 2017. Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 6.6 percent in  FY2016/17 and then rebound to 7.2 percent in FY2017/18, due to temporary disruptions (primarily  to private consumption) caused by cash shortages accompanying the currency exchange initiative.  These effects are expected to gradually dissipate by March 2017 as cash shortages ease and  would be offset by tailwinds from a favorable monsoon and low oil prices, and continued  progress in resolving supply-side bottlenecks. Consumer sentiment remains strong, which will  support near-term growth recovery as cash shortages ease.3 The investment recovery is expected  to remain modest and uneven across sectors as deleveraging takes place and industrial capacity  utilization picks up. Headwinds from weaknesses in India’s bank balance sheets will also weigh on  near-term credit growth in the economy. Confidence and policy credibility gains, including from  continued fiscal consolidation and anti-inflationary monetary policy, continue to underpin  macroeconomic stability. Weak external demand, however, is expected to dampen net exports.

7. GST adoption and continued progress in reforms bode well for a marked  improvement in medium-term prospects. In staff’s view, the consumption-led growth path can  be sustained over the medium term, as real disposable incomes rise and India continues the  process of economic catch-up (given its very low per capita incomes). Although some  uncertainties remain around the design and pace of implementation of the GST, its adoption is  poised to help raise India’s medium-term GDP growth to above 8 percent as it will create a single  national market and enhance the efficiency of intra-Indian movement of goods and services.  
8. CPI inflation is expected to remain contained in the near term, but inflationary  pressures are set to rise in the second half of 2017. With temporary demand disruptions and  increased monsoon-driven food supplies, CPI inflation is expected at about 4¾ percent by early  2017—in line with the RBI inflation target of 5 percent by March 2017. However, inflationary  pressures are likely to reappear in the second half of 2017, in part reflecting government pay

reviews and the waning effects of the oil price collapse.4 Upside risks to inflation stem from  supply-side factors, such as volatility of agricultural prices, including due to possible smaller  harvests as a result of cash shortages inhibiting purchases of agricultural inputs.  
9. The current account deficit (CAD) is expected to remain compressed, helped by  continued low commodity-import prices. The CAD has declined sharply in recent years to an  average of 1.4 percent of GDP during FY2013/14–FY2015/16, and is expected to be about  1.1 percent of GDP (about US$25 billion) in 2016/17. This narrowing was helped by a decline in  commodity (oil and gold) prices. The CAD is expected to widen to about 2 percent of GDP over  the medium term, as domestic demand strengthens further and commodity prices gradually  rebound. Nonetheless, the weakening of trading  
partners’ external demand is expected to pose

10. The rupee weakened and capital inflows reversed after the announcement of the  currency exchange initiative, but this may have also reflected the global capital flow  retrenchment from emerging market assets. In the two weeks after the announcement of the  currency exchange initiative on November 8, 2016, the rupee weakened by 2½ percent against  the U.S. dollar, portfolio capital outflows totaled US$3.5 billion, and the SENSEX equity index fell  by 6 percent. While the rupee subsequently rebounded by about 1 percent by mid-December,  portfolio outflows continued (cumulative outflows of US$2.2 billion so far during FY2016/17, after  inflows of US$6.8 billion prior to November 8).  
11. Bank credit growth remains moderate, reflecting demand and supply factors,  including slow corporate deleveraging, sector-specific strains, and further weakening of  bank asset quality. Even as the banking system’s ratio of stressed assets remained stable during  FY2015/16, subsequent to the Asset Quality Review (AQR), the system-wide gross non-performing  asset (NPA) ratio has risen from 5.1 percent in September 2015 to 7.6 percent in March 2016 and  is expected to rise further by an additional one percentage point towards the end of FY2016/17.  Aggregate credit growth remains modest, and is primarily led by private banks (one-quarter of  Indian banking system assets) and better performing public sector banks (PSBs). However, the

banking system’s capacity to expand credit is constrained by the weakened capital, profitability  and asset quality of many PSBs. The ability of the banking system to address its asset quality  distress will hinge on the success of the AQR, the new bankruptcy code, and asset reconstruction  mechanisms. Meanwhile, the investment plans of core industrial sectors remain thin, reflecting  still-low capacity utilization and deleveraging pressures. Nonetheless, capital markets, nonbank  financial institutions, and retained earnings will continue to support the commercial financing  needs of the economy.

12. Economic risks are tilted to the downside. On the external side, despite the reduced  imbalances and strengthened reserve buffers, the impact from global financial market volatility  could be disruptive, including from U.S. monetary policy normalization or weaker-than-expected  global growth. In the absence of disruptive global financial volatility, slower growth in China,  Europe and the United States would have only modest adverse spillovers to India, given weak  trade linkages. A key domestic risk stems from the government’s currency exchange initiative,  where the near-term adverse economic impact of accompanying cash shortages remains difficult  to gauge, while it may have a positive economic impact in the medium term. Domestic risks also  flow from a potential further deterioration of corporate and public bank balance sheets, as well as  setbacks in the reform process, including in GST design and implementation, which could weigh  on domestic demand-driven growth and undermine investor and consumer sentiment. On the  upside, larger than expected gains from the GST and further structural reforms could lead to  significantly stronger growth; while a sustained period of continued-low global energy prices  would also be beneficial to India (see Annex II: Risk Assessment Matrix).  
Authorities’ Views  
13. The authorities were of the view that the near and medium-term outlook remains  encouraging. They emphasized the wide ranging reforms that have been implemented by the  country since the last Article IV consultations with IMF, which included promulgation of the Goods  and Services Tax Act, Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and  Services) Act 2016, notification of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 and operationalization of  National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT)  for the new corporate insolvency framework, formalization of the monetary policy committee,  enhanced liberalization of the FDI regime and initiatives to improve infrastructure. These have

INDIA 
translated into stronger macroeconomic fundamentals and more resilient growth. The authorities  also indicated the role played by Direct Benefit Transfer and JAM (Jan Dhan Yojana bank  accounts, Aadhaar identification, and mobile banking) trinity in complementing efforts of the  government towards achievement of inclusive growth and fiscal consolidation. They expected  agricultural output to improve following the return to a normal monsoon, industrial output to firm  up, and services sector growth to remain stable. They agreed that while the replacement of  specific banknotes could weigh on economic activity in cash sensitive sectors in the short run, this  effect would not extend beyond two quarters, and would be outweighed by the positive medium term impact from a more efficient payments system and greater formalization of business  activities. Looking ahead, the authorities agreed with staff that the overall impact of the GST on  growth would be positive. More generally, the continuation of structural reforms would  strengthen growth outcomes in the medium term.  
14. Risks to the outlook were seen as coming more importantly from abroad. In  particular, the authorities felt that though weak global growth and the potential of financial  spillovers in a world characterized by highly accommodative monetary policies and negative  interest rates in many advanced economies posed risks for India, the country was well prepared to  navigate any accompanying turbulence. They also expressed concern about prospects for their  exports, stemming from a possible upsurge in protectionism in advanced economy markets.  
KEY POLICY ISSUES  
A. Strengthening the Financial Sector and Reining in Risks  
15. The policy impetus to clean up banks’ balance sheets has led to a considerable  uptick in the recognition of non-performing assets (NPAs) among Indian banks. NPA  slippages, particularly among public sector banks (PSBs), accelerated considerably to 7.2 percent  in FY2015/16, up from 3.4 percent in FY2014/15.5 The sharp rise in new NPAs reflects a strong  policy impetus from the RBI to enforce robust asset quality recognition and a bank balance sheet  clean-up by March 2017, following an AQR initiated in December 2015. The share of restructured  assets in total advances receded to 4.1 percent, from 7.1 percent a year earlier, due to more active  re-classification of standard restructured loans into NPAs as a result of the AQR. However, the  ratio of stressed assets (restructured assets and NPAs) continued to edge up to 10.8 percent at  end-FY2015/16 (from 10 percent a year earlier), in part reflecting broader recognition of NPAs and  slippages in previously un-restructured exposures. Altogether, most AQR-related recognition of  NPAs appears to have already materialized.  
16. However, provisioning and debt recovery remain key challenges for banks. NPA  recognition has led to an uptick in provisioning, accounting for a further decline in PSBs'  profitability, with the ROA of PSBs turning negative in FY2015/16. However, the PSBs’ aggregate  provisioning coverage ratio continues to be low, at 39 percent as of end-FY2015/16, raising  
5 The NPA slippage ratio is the ratio of gross new NPAs during the year to standard assets at the beginning of the  year. Estimates of NPA slippages, and shares of restructured and stressed assets are from RBI data based on  OSMOS returns. 
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9 
INDIA  
concerns about its sufficiency.6 Moreover, PSBs’ loan recovery capacity remains weak, with efforts  to counteract the rise in NPAs met primarily through write-offs. Write-offs accounted for a  1.2 percentage-point offset in NPA slippage rates in FY2015/16, while loan recoveries accounted  for only 0.6 percentage points (down from 0.8 percentage points a year earlier), underscoring the  need for timely implementation of debt resolution reforms.  
17. The slowly improving but still elevated corporate sector vulnerabilities continue to  pose risks to banks’ soundness. Corporate vulnerabilities have subsided in FY2015/16, reflecting  policy measures to ease supply-side bottlenecks. Firms’ debt-repayment capacity improved—the  share of debt held by firms with weak debt-repayment capacity (interest coverage ratio below  one) declined to 16.6 percent in FY2015/16, from 20.2 percent a year earlier (see Selected Issues  Chapter I).7 Leverage levels generally remain high, with debt of highly-levered firms (debt-to equity ratios above 150 percent) accounting for about a half of overall debt. Importantly, high  leverage is concentrated in certain industries—including metals and mining, construction and  engineering, and transportation and infrastructure—which jointly account for a large share of the  
system’s debt-at-risk. The high debt-at-risk in  these sectors—as high as 36 percent in metals  40 
and mining—pose NPA slippage risks for banks.  30

In addition, the vulnerability of the corporate  sector to external shocks remains non-trivial,  despite increased foreign exchange hedging.8

Sources: CapitalIQ; and IMF staff estimates. 
Note: Based on a sample of 2,057 firms. Top 50 firms based on total assets. Leverage is the  median debt-to-equity ratio within each group, excluding 227 firms with negative equity.  Debt-at-risk is the share of debt of firms with interest coverage ratio (ICR) less than 1 in each  group's overall debt.
18. The slow deleveraging and repair of corporate balance sheets and the potential further build-up of new NPAs can have detrimental effects on the real economy. The pace of  credit growth has so far been supported by government capital injections in PSBs and a shift of  credit demand toward private banks and alternatives to bank lending, such as commercial paper  
6 The 2017 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update will examine the issue of provisioning against  problem loans in more detail.  
7 Debt-at-risk denotes debt held by firms with weak debt-repayment capacity, i.e. interest coverage ratios (ICRs)  below one. The corporate risk analysis is based on a sample of 1,830 to 2,057 firms with data from CapitalIQ.  
8 Corporate FX funding via external commercial borrowings (ECBs) continued to account for about 13 percent of  total funding at end-March 2016. RBI data on intentions to hedge foreign currency (FX) debt suggest that  corporates’ hedging ratio (excluding natural hedges) increased to about 46.8 percent of borrowings in the first half  of FY2015/16, up from 33.8 percent in FY2013/14. Sensitivity tests also suggest that risks related to a rupee  depreciation and a rise in global funding rates are more pronounced relative to earlier years (FY2012/13).

(CP) funding.9 However, the need for capital preservation has led to a marked slowdown of credit  growth at PSBs, down to 4.0 percent year-on-year as of March 2016 from an average of  11.7 percent in the preceding three years (credit growth figures from RBI Financial Stability  Report). Altogether, a larger-than-anticipated increase in new NPA formation due to shocks  affecting corporates’ debt repayment capacity—e.g., due to weaker demand in certain sectors, or  exchange rate or interest rate shocks—or PSBs’ inability to raise adequate capital, could further  dampen the provision of credit to the real economy and impair growth (Figure). While the credit  intensity of the Indian economy is relatively low, the risk of an increase in NPAs is exacerbated by  high corporate leverage, which magnify banks’ losses in response to shocks, and has already been  a drag on domestic investment. The limited monetary and fiscal space in India constrains  policymakers’ capacity to counteract any additional increase in NPAs due to a long gestation of  corporate projects or further domestic or external shocks.  
19. PSBs’ capital augmentation needs are expected to have a modest fiscal impact. At  present, all PSBs meet Basel III capital requirements, with an aggregate common equity Tier 1  
(CET-1) ratio of 8.7 percent as of end-FY2015/16, above the 6.125 minimum requirement  (including a capital conservation buffer, CCB) under India’s implementation schedule.10 However,  further balance sheet clean-up and Basel III implementation should account for additional PSB  recapitalization needs in the coming years, at about 1.5 to 2.4 percent of FY2018/19 GDP  (cumulatively over the next three years) under a simulation assuming a transition of 25 percent of  restructured loans to NPAs; 40 percent minimum provisioning coverage ratio; and build-up of an  additional 0 to 2 percentage-point capital buffer, respectively.Under this simulation, the  government share would range between 1 to 1.6 percent of FY2018/19 GDP (cumulatively over  
9 The government announced in the FY2016/17 Budget injection of Rs 229 billion of capital in PSBs, 75 percent of  which was disbursed immediately to support lending operations and enable PSBs to tap market funding.  
10 All but one bank (a private bank) currently meet Basel III’s minimum common equity tier-1 (CET 1) and Tier-1  capital requirements. Banks’ CET-1 capital positions were also supported by the RBI’s easing of capital  requirements in March 2016, permitting banks’ use of property holdings’ revaluation reserves, among others, as  CET-1 capital. 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11 
INDIA  
the next three years).11 This estimate includes a cumulative capital injection of 0.5–0.8 percent of  FY2018/19 GDP, related to the ongoing implementation of Basel III in India, expected to be  finalized by March 2019. However, recapitalization costs would be considerably higher if there is a  policy shift to more conservative provisioning requirements.  
20. Recent policy reforms have been extensive, targeting a PSB balance sheet clean-up,  and improving distressed asset resolution mechanisms. The AQR, initiated by the RBI in  December 2015, prompted banks to take active steps to recognize all NPAs and ensure the  achievement of clean and appropriately provisioned balance sheets by March 2017. In an effort to  improve debt resolution mechanisms, a scheme permitting debt-to-equity conversions of  unsustainable portions of banks' exposures was introduced by the RBI in June 2016.12 Importantly,  the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, adopted in May 2016, targets a drastic reduction in the  timing of bad asset resolution, from an existing average of 4.3 years to about 180 days, and  consolidates legal treatment of bankruptcy. Also, the regime for foreign ownership of Asset  Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) was relaxed, permitting foreigners to take full stakes in ARCs.  Further, the UDAY scheme, aimed at reviving distressed state-owned electricity distribution  companies (DISCOMs), envisages state governments taking on 75 percent of the DISCOMs’ debt  owed to banks which, together with accompanying measures to improve operational efficiency  should also help rein in further bank asset quality deterioration (see Box 2). Finally, the eligibility  criteria for government recapitalization support to troubled PSBs were amended in September  2016, and now focus on a PSB’s cost of operations, credit quality and ability to recover assets.  
21. Ensuring adequate capitalization, full recognition of risks on PSB’s balance sheets, and  NPA resolution are key to maintaining financial stability and enhancing the ability of the  financial sector to contribute to growth. In this regard, staff recommends:  
· Ensuring Adequate PSB Capitalization. To support PSBs' current lending capacity, the authorities  should consider larger government capital injections in PSBs and some divestments of banks’ non core assets. The government’s capital injections in PSBs are thus far modest in scale (0.2 percent of  projected FY2018/19 GDP cumulatively over the next three years), and largely leave  recapitalizations up to affected PSBs to raise capital in the markets. The new recapitalization norms  introduced by the government are welcome, as they link potential support to performance, and  thus create a clear demarcation between better-performing and worse-performing banks, which  can open up the way for potential restructuring, including mergers and acquisitions, in the  banking sector.  
· NPA Resolution. A more comprehensive strategy, building on the Indian authorities’ policies to  boost banks’ NPA resolution capacity, is needed. In this regard, staff recommends the following:  
11 The estimate for the government’s share assumes no dilution of government ownership in PSBs, currently at  about 61 percent. Implementation of the Basel III capital framework is progressing and is expected to be  completed by end-March 2019. However, potential Basel III-related risk weight changes might necessitate  additional capital infusions.  
12 The Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets (S4A). 
12 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  
INDIA 
o Continued stringent supervision. Following the conclusion of the AQR, the authorities  should persist in their commitment to robust supervision of banks’ activities, including  regulatory requirements for frequent in-depth reporting of NPA portfolios, ongoing  monitoring of banks’ capital and profitability, intensive on-site supervision, and enhanced  regulation and guidance. More robust provisioning should also be pursued.  
o Corporate debt resolution. Several asset restructuring mechanisms—including 5:25  Refinance Scheme, Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR), and S4A—have been introduced  to facilitate corporate restructuring and debt resolution.13 As corporate debt  
restructuring thus far has been limited, the authorities should place priority on  continuing to incentivize use of these mechanisms, and implementing measures to  rehabilitate distressed sectors. Efforts to improve corporate debt restructuring should  also ensure prompt implementation of the new Bankruptcy Code, and introduction of  out-of-court corporate debt restructuring mechanisms.  
o Distressed debt markets. The market for distressed debt in India is underdeveloped,  and suffers from difficulties in price discovery and low capitalization of Asset  Reconstruction Companies (ARCs). The authorities should follow through on recent  steps taken to develop this market in India, and should examine the costs and benefits  of market-based mechanisms for the rehabilitation of distressed, but viable, firms,  such as corporate restructuring vehicles that rely on asset management companies  with experience in corporate turnarounds.14 
· PSB Governance Reforms. The authorities should follow through on their commitment to structural  reforms, as outlined in the Indradhanush plan (August 2015), by strengthening ongoing NPA  disclosures; enhancing PSBs’ governance (including risk management practices and  accountability); and considering divestments and mergers.  
· Banks’ Statutory Liquidity Requirement. As the general government fiscal deficit continues to  contract, the Statutory Liquidity Requirement (SLR) should be reduced further to facilitate  more private sector lending, which can also be positive for the further development of the  corporate bond market. The Indian government has been gradually reducing the SLR rate  (currently at 20.5 percent, down from 25 percent of deposit liabilities in mid-2008).  
22. The authorities should continue their efforts to develop the domestic corporate debt  market. Pursuant to the recommendations of the Khan Committee, Indian regulators have  introduced wide-reaching reforms (see Box 3). The new measures should provide a fillip to the  
13 Under the 5:25 refinance scheme, banks can extend loan repayments for up to 25 years, with an option of loan  refinancing every five years.  
14 These include new RBI guidelines on banks’ sales of distressed assets; and liberalization of FDI in ARCs by  increasing the investment limit under the automatic route to 100 percent of the paid-up capital of an ARC (from  49 percent previously). FIIs/FPIs are now also allowed to invest up to 100 percent of each tranche of ARC-issued  Security Receipts (SRs), subject to sectoral caps. 
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13 
INDIA  
development of the Indian corporate bond market, but would be made more effective by: (i)  strengthening corporate balance sheets through vigorous rehabilitation and restructuring to raise  demand for corporate bond issuances; (ii) developing risk transfer mechanisms, including the  CDS market, to better support domestic institutional investment; and (iii) ensuring continued  coordination on developing the bond market across key relevant agencies, including the  Government of India, RBI, and Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).15 
23. The Indian government continues to work towards enhancing financial inclusion.  The financial inclusion agenda has broadened over the past two years, evolving from providing  greater access to bank accounts and financial services to introducing more remunerative savings  vehicles to diminish the luster of traditional gold-based savings. The government’s introduction of  gold monetization schemes can boost financial intermediation by channeling domestic gold  holdings to gold savings accounts, although uptake thus far has been minimal. The launch of  Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in August 2014 led to the opening of bank accounts for  254 million previously unbanked individuals (see Box 4). There is now continued emphasis on  increasing transactional volumes on the PMJDY accounts (including by Aadhaar-supported direct  benefit transfers). 16 The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) scheme has sought to facilitate  access to formal finance for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises through collateral-free  loans, with close to 1 percent of GDP in loans having been disbursed under this scheme. The  emphasis on financial inclusion should continue to be facilitated by new technologies, making greater  use of mobile phone payments technology, such as the Unified Payments Interface platform  introduced earlier this year, which links use of multiple bank accounts with banking services,  including person-to-person transfers and merchant payments.  
Authorities’ Views  
24. The authorities agreed that corporate balance sheets in some sectors remain  strained, but noted that steps were being taken to address vulnerabilities, including in the  banking sector. They saw early signs that the financial health of listed corporates is improving.  Efforts continue to reactivate stalled investment projects in the infrastructure sector, while the  UDAY scheme is contributing to balance sheet repair for electricity distribution companies. On the  banking side, the AQR has imposed a homogenous loan classification standard across the system  and has been triggering adequate recognition, allowing the focus to shift to the resolution of  NPAs. The mechanisms put in place by the RBI allow for tailored workouts depending on the  specific causes of asset impairment, and the authorities expect an increase in their use while  acknowledging that the resolution process will be gradual and take time. The new insolvency  regime assigns a limited role to tribunals and already ensures dialogue between debtors and  
15 Regulators—including RBI and SEBI—have been active in introducing numerous measures to deepen India’s  corporate bond market based on the recommendations of the inter-agency Working Group on Development of  Corporate Bond Market (published in August 2016).

creditors. Nonetheless, the authorities are currently looking at the draft Arbitration Act to  introduce some clauses that would allow out-of-court settlement.  
25. The authorities underscored their commitment to ensuring adequate bank  capitalization as per prudential requirements, maintaining stringent supervision, and  deepening financial inclusion efforts. They pointed out that of the estimated capital needs of  public sector banks (Rs 1.8 trillion through FY2018/19), Rs 0.7 trillion was to be infused by the  Government. As part of this plan, the Government has infused Rs 250 billion in FY2015/16 and is  infusing Rs 229 billion in FY2016/17. Banks have raised additional AT1 and Tier II capital in the  market. Remaining capital needs would be covered from these alternative sources. With regard to  staff’s assessment of remaining vulnerabilities, the authorities pointed out that the interest  coverage ratio as a gauge for underlying corporate balance sheet health needs to be viewed in  the context of cyclically depressed profits. They also noted that the decline in the provision  coverage of banks reflected the countercyclical nature of the provisioning regime. They pointed  out that the leverage ratio at sample levels were quite sensitive to sample selections and that the  system-level leverage of Indian corporates was not large, while it was stressed for certain sectors.  
B. Monetary Policy to Anchor Inflation  
26. After some pick-up earlier in the year, CPI inflation has moderated in recent months.  CPI inflation declined from an average of 9.8 percent during 2011–13 to an average of 4.9 percent  in FY2015/16, driven by the collapse in global commodity prices, a range of supply-side measures,  and a relatively tight monetary stance. Inflation dropped to 3.6 percent in November 2016, from  
an average of 5.4 percent in the first half of FY2016/17, largely due to a fall in the prices of  vegetables. Underlying inflation momentum remained steady, however, with core inflation  averaging 4.7 percent from April to November. Given the disinflation shock from the currency  exchange initiative, widening the output gap to around ¾ of one percent of GDP, inflation is  expected to remain at about 4¾ percent in March  
2017. In the medium term, inflation is expected to  remain within the RBI’s medium-term inflation

27. Following the policy rate cuts in 2015–16, monetary conditions remain consistent  with coming near the RBI’s interim inflation target of 5 percent by March 2017. With the real  policy interest rate at about 1.25 percent, which is at the lower end of the mission’s estimated  
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15 
INDIA 
neutral range of about 1.25–1.75 percent given current external conditions, the monetary policy  stance is assessed to be broadly neutral. Any inflationary effects of the GST when implemented  are expected to be small and transitory—if needed, the monetary policy response should be  geared toward containing potential second-round effects. Given medium-term upside risks to  food and CPI inflation, the authorities should stand ready to raise the policy rate if inflationary  pressures gather pace.  
28. Monetary policy credibility has strengthened with the finalization of the flexible  inflation targeting framework and agreement on the official medium-term inflation target. Amendments to the RBI Act and the formation of the Monetary Policy Committee (September  2016) completed the statutory underpinning of flexible inflation targeting, and the headline CPI  inflation target of 4 percent with a symmetrical band of 2 percent was retained as the official  inflation target for the next five years (August 2016). The RBI has taken steps to improve the  operating framework and has focused on enabling greater transmission of policy rate cuts. These  steps include adjusting the liquidity management framework, guidelines to ensure consistency in  banks’ calculation of lending rates, and more frequent revisions of administered rates on small  savings schemes.17 The increase in banking system liquidity as a result of the currency exchange  initiative can reduce banks’ funding costs and thereby lead to a decline in bank lending rates.  Nonetheless, bringing down inflation expectations of the general public and anchoring them at a  lower level has proven challenging, as food inflation propagates rapidly into non-food inflation,  and household inflation expectations remain near double digits.18 Terminating the adaptive  nature of Indian household inflation expectations will likely require a prolonged period of low  inflation, underpinned by a continued anti-inflationary monetary policy stance.

29. Supply-side reforms, particularly in agriculture, continued fiscal consolidation, and  relieving impediments to monetary transmission are prerequisites for low inflation in the  medium term. While inflation targeting has served India well over the past two years, by  providing a well-defined nominal anchor and a clear policy objective and thus improving policy  
17 In April 2016, the RBI announced a narrowing of the policy rate corridor from +/- 100 bps to +/- 50 bps and  moved towards reducing the liquidity deficit associated with the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF).

16 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  
INDIA 
communication, further reforms will need to complement the new framework to durably reduce  inflation. Consensus Surveys show that five-year ahead inflation expectations have come down by  about ¾ of one percentage point since 2014, but remain above the midpoint of the inflation  target band (4 percent CPI inflation). In view of India’s large weight on food in its CPI basket and  structurally-high food inflation, achieving this target on a sustained basis will require structural  reforms to ramp up food supply commensurate with strong consumption demand. Staff sees  scope to improve food grain buffer stock management, and for increasing investment in storage  and distribution infrastructure for perishable produce. Continued fiscal consolidation to narrow  public sector demand for credit remains paramount for the success of the new monetary  framework, as does further reducing impediments to monetary transmission (including reductions  in still-high SLR rates).19  
Authorities’ Views  
30. The authorities were confident about the prospects of keeping inflation close to the  center of the target band in the medium-term. They considered the current monetary stance  to be accommodative and noted that the future stance would be data dependent. The authorities  agreed that the output gap remained negative, and they estimated that the neutral real interest  rate had declined to 1.25 percent. In their view, recent reforms to the monetary policy and  liquidity management framework had improved the transmission of monetary policy. Anchoring  household expectations has remained a challenge, but the authorities felt that these should not  be overemphasized in policy setting, as inflation expectations appeared backward-looking and  closely related to food inflation at the time of the survey. The authorities agreed with staff on the  importance of continued supply-side reforms to keep food inflation low and help anchor inflation  expectations.  
C. Continuing Fiscal Consolidation  
31. The near-term fiscal policy envisages a gradual reduction in fiscal deficits. The  FY2015/16 Union Budget execution was in line with the target, as a series of fuel excise hikes  offset higher-than-expected food subsidies and a shortfall in corporate income tax and  disinvestment proceeds. Accordingly, revenue measures allowed for a planned ¼ of one  percentage point increase in the ratio of public investment to GDP, which had been on a declining  trend for several years. The FY2016/17 Budget targets a fiscal deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP  (equivalent to about 3.8 percent of GDP in IMF terms) and thus a return to fiscal consolidation, as  has been consistently advocated by staff, and which is expected to be achieved. The key risk to  the current year’s revenue target is the repercussions from the currency exchange initiative, which  could dent tax collections and disinvestment receipts (which are classified as revenues under the  authorities’ definition). Meeting the deficit target may necessitate expenditure cuts, including  
19 On asymmetric monetary transmission, see S. Das (2015), “Monetary Policy in India: Transmission to Bank  Interest Rates,” IMF WP 15/129. Transmission would benefit from reducing the SLR over time to a level in line with  the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), continued focus on increasing competition in the banking sector, and further  progress on financial inclusion, which will decrease the presence of informal finance. 
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17 
INDIA 
lower capital spending. The authorities should leverage the increase in the formal economy as a  result of the currency exchange initiative, as well as associated income declaration schemes, to  expand the tax revenue base. If needed, the authorities should continue to take the opportunity to  raise petroleum-product taxes while oil prices remain low.  
32. The authorities have made strong progress on subsidy reforms in the past two years. A major decline in the subsidy bill (down from 2.5 percent of GDP in FY2012/13 to about  1.5 percent of GDP expected in FY2016/17) has been achieved. This involved the near-elimination  of fuel subsidies, and increasing use of direct benefit transfers to channel the remaining  commodity subsidies (including the PAHAL scheme for cooking gas, and digitization and Aadhaar seeding of Public Distribution System food subsidy beneficiaries) and social payments. The  Aadhaar Act passed in early 2016 is an important reform that enables linking of entitlements and  subsidies to biometric identification of beneficiaries, thereby advancing more efficient targeting of  social programs.  
33. With continued delays in reaching the medium-term deficit target, India’s public  debt ratio is projected to remain high and decline only gradually. Even though introduction  of the GST has helped clarify the government’s medium-term fiscal plans, in the absence of major  additional expenditure reforms, achievement of the Union deficit target of 3 percent of GDP by  FY2017/18 and thereafter,20 may be further delayed. Such delays could undermine confidence and  credibility, and reduce available fiscal space for priority spending in the medium term. Staff’s  projections, which are on the basis of current policies and assume no major legislative changes,  suggest that the central government will underperform against its fiscal adjustment targets. In  addition, salary increases by the states will not only impede reduction of state budget deficits but  will also likely entail public investment cuts in states bound by the borrowing limits. The general  government fiscal deficit is thus projected to remain elevated in the range of 6–7 percent of GDP  through FY2018/19. Accordingly, public debt as a share of GDP is projected to remain at almost  70 percent by end-FY2016/17, and will decline gradually over the medium term, remaining above  India’s debt tolerance range (60–65 percent of GDP) for several years.21 India’s public debt, with a  favorable maturity structure and currency composition, as well as a captive domestic investor  base, is expected remain sustainable (see Annex III: Debt Sustainability Analysis).22 
34. India has limited fiscal space given the need to reduce its high level of public debt.  India’s general government deficit is high by global standards, posing a challenge to durably    
20 To institutionalize financial discipline in public finances, the 2003 Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management  (FRBM) Act introduced a medium-term ceiling for the central government’s fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP. As  per FRBM, state deficits have been effectively bound by a borrowing limit of 3 percent of any given state’s GDP,  and states’ deficits have on average remained near the limits. The FRBM Review Committee is at present  examining the pros and cons behind altering the fiscal rules attached to the FRBM.  
21 Even though the general government primary deficit is estimated to have declined by about ¾ of one percent  of GDP during FY2014/15-FY2015/16, the lower contribution of automatic debt dynamics on account of slower  nominal GDP growth contributed to an increase in public debt ratio. In addition, states have issued about Rs 1.6  trillion in UDAY bonds since the launch of the scheme in November 2015, which did not count towards states’  annual borrowing limits but increased the public debt stock by over one percent of GDP.  
22 India’s sovereign debt credit ratings are at the lowest investment grade (Moody’s Baa3; S&P BBB-; Fitch BBB-).

INDIA 
reducing inflation. In addition, the interest cost of public debt is one fourth of general  government revenues, and financial repression (operating through the SLR) ensures low real  interest rates on public debt and helps underpin debt sustainability. Reducing the SLR, making  more room for private credit, can safely proceed only if the debt burden is reduced.  
35. Staff sees merit in strengthening the fiscal responsibility framework of the center to  anchor policies. To limit pro-cyclical fiscal policy, the fiscal responsibility framework could feature  a ceiling on nominal expenditure growth and be underpinned by a medium-term fiscal framework  
to facilitate better planning and protect public investment. Staff also recommends anchoring the  deficit reduction path by setting a medium-term public debt target and specifically a debt-to-GDP  ratio of 60 percent, in line with staff estimates of India’s debt tolerance range.23 Rebuilding of  fiscal space should be complemented by reorienting public expenditure away from untargeted  subsidies towards growth-enhancing capital and social spending.  
36. Implementing a robust goods and services tax (GST), enhancing fiscal federalism,  and continued subsidy reforms are policy priorities. Staff recommends:  
· Tax reform. India’s tax revenue-to-GDP ratio (at around 17½ percent) remains  considerably below its emerging market peers. Implementation of a robust GST should be a key  priority given its growth-enhancing effects. The GST should have minimal exemptions, uniform  cross-state rates, and as few tax rate tiers as possible (see Box 5). Key production inputs, such as  energy and real estate, should be kept within the tax base to enable greater output gains and  reduce the tax burden across sectors. Rationalization of the structure of direct taxes toward a  lower corporate income tax rate with smaller and streamlined deductions and exemptions should  continue. Efforts to improve tax administration should be stepped up as the scope for revenue  gains is large.  
· Fiscal discipline. Rebuilding general government fiscal space and increasing the efficiency  of public expenditure call for enhancing fiscal institutions of both the Union and the states. Fiscal  responsibility frameworks should be strengthened to ensure compliance with fiscal targets and  the quality of fiscal adjustment, including through setting up of an independent fiscal council for  the center, strengthening medium-term expenditure and budget frameworks, and moving to  accrual accounting (see Selected Issues Chapter III). The authorities should take advantage of the  newly-created establishment of the South Asia Regional Technical Assistance and Training Center  (SARTTAC), based in New Delhi, to strengthen institutional capacity and skills, including at the  state level.  
· Subsidy reform. Overhauling India’s food and fertilizer subsidy regime via better targeting,  improving efficiency, and reducing distortions can generate substantial fiscal gains. Untargeted  food subsidies should be pared back, including by rationalizing the list of eligible beneficiaries  and reforming the inefficient Food Corporation of India (FCI) and the Public Distribution System  
23 IMF staff analysis (see Selected Issues Chapter II) suggests that India’s estimated debt-to-GDP threshold for  maintaining its current level of market creditworthiness lies in the range of 65-70 percent. Inclusion of some buffer  to account for uncertainty (including for the materialization of contingent liabilities), suggests a debt ratio of 60– 65 percent of GDP.

(PDS) network. Wider application of the current approach to non-food subsidy payments—namely  direct benefit transfers, increased financial inclusion, and use of the Aadhaar identification system  to better identify beneficiaries—should continue to yield large fiscal savings (see also Selected  Issues Chapter IV).  
Authorities’ Views 
37. The authorities reiterated their commitment to achieving the 3.5 percent of GDP  deficit target (authorities’ definition) in 2016/17. They stated that any slippage in spectrum  sales would be made up by buoyancy in tax receipts (including revenues from the income  declaration scheme. Moreover, interest expenses were expected to be lower than budgeted owing  to the recent contraction of sovereign yields.  
38. Looking ahead, the authorities would continue to balance adherence to fiscal  consolidation with a commitment to increase investment and social spending. Further  consolidation would be achieved through higher growth and revenue mobilization from other  sources. The authorities noted that the 2017/18 deficit target would be finalized once the FRBM  Review Committee recommendations had been received and reviewed. The authorities were  confident that the outstanding issues related to GST implementation could be settled promptly.  The GST would provide for a significant improvement over the current indirect tax system. Tax  reform priorities going forward include continuing the phased reduction of the corporate income  tax rate from 30 to 25 percent over four years, coupled with a simultaneous reduction in tax  deductions. On the expenditure side, initiatives such as the rationalization of centrally-sponsored  schemes, the advancement of the Union Budget presentation by one month for better execution  planning, the merger of the railways budget with the Union budget, elimination of distinction  between plan and non-plan expenditure, and the gradual replacement of generalized subsidies by  direct benefit transfers, would all enhance the quality of public spending (see also Annex V:  Expenditure Reforms).  
D. Maintaining External Stability  
39. India’s external position remains broadly consistent with medium-term  fundamentals and desirable policy settings, and reserves are assessed to be adequate (see  Annex IV on External Sector Assessment). Following a US$55 billion increase in international  reserves over FY2014/15 and FY2015/16, driven by robust capital inflows (chiefly FDI and FPI  portfolio equity flows), reserves have remained close to their end-March 2016 level, standing at  about US$360 billion as of late-December 2016, slightly above 150 percent of the IMF’s reserve  adequacy metric and around 8 months of import cover. Foreign exchange (FX) intervention  continues to be guided by the need to limit excessive volatility, and has been limited during 2015  and 2016. While positive policy settings and continued macroeconomic stability have reduced  external vulnerabilities, there is a continued need for vigilance given sharp movements in global  commodity prices and global financial market volatility.

40. Boosting exports remains a key challenge. Despite a sharp contraction in merchandise  exports, India’s trade balance improved in 2015/16 due to an increase in the oil trade balance by  about 2 percent of GDP as well as weak non-oil import growth. The contraction in merchandise  exports was partly due to the collapse in commodity prices (refined petroleum products made up  about one-fifth of the value of goods exports in 2014/15), weak global demand, and ongoing  appreciation of the rupee real effective exchange rate.24 Nonetheless, India’s export performance  was comparable to that of emerging market peers, and its share in world merchandise exports has  remained relatively stable.

41. Although India’s external financing requirements have declined with shrinking  current account imbalances, further enhancing the environment for attracting stable, non debt creating capital flows, particularly FDI, remains important. In the past two years, several  steps have been taken toward this goal, including by liberalizing caps on FDI inflows in most  sectors—this has helped FDI inflows increase from US$31 billion in FY2013/14 to over US$45  billion in FY2015/16, far exceeding the FY2015/16 CAD of US$22 billion (see Selected Issues  Chapter VI). Nonetheless, a more conducive business environment is necessary to attract even  greater FDI flows and help ensure the success of the “Make in India” initiative. In addition,  restrictions on foreign borrowing by firms were relaxed in 2015 and limits for foreign portfolio  investors’ (FPI) purchases of government bonds were increased in 2016. India’s external debt  remains low at 23 percent of GDP at end-June 2016, given that net external borrowing by Indian  corporates was minimal in 2014/15 and 2015/16. Further liberalization of external commercial  borrowings (ECBs) should proceed cautiously and be carefully monitored by the RBI, given  continuing corporate vulnerabilities.  
42. In the event of a surge in global financial market volatility, India should continue to  rely on exchange rate flexibility as the main shock absorber. As consistently advocated by  
24 Using staff’s average estimated income elasticity of exports of 1.5, in the absence of further measures to  enhance competiveness, India’s merchandise export growth will likely remain below 10 percent per annum (see M.  Raissi and V. Tulin (2015), “Price and Income Elasticity of Indian Exports: Supply-Side Bottlenecks,” IMF WP 15/161).  
25 According to the World Trade Organization’s 2016 World Tariff Profile, India’s tariff rate (a simple average of  MFN tariff rates) is 13.4 percent for all products, 32.7 percent for agricultural products, and 10.1 percent for non agricultural products—in all three cases India’s rates are among the highest across emerging market economies.  
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21 
INDIA 
staff, to minimize disruptive movements in the currency divorced from fundamentals, continued  exchange rate flexibility could be accompanied by judicious FX intervention, either through spot  and forward markets, or via liquidity provision through swaps.  
Authorities’ Views 
43. The authorities concurred with the assessment of the external position. They were  broadly comfortable with the current level of reserves, but noted that the direction of reserves  would depend on developments in capital flows. While the trade deficit was likely to widen due to  weakening terms of trade and remittances have declined, the current account deficit was expected  to remain relatively subdued and below its sustainable level, which they estimated at about  2<U+2153> percent of GDP. The authorities attributed recent export weakness mainly to sluggish external  demand. They were optimistic about scope to expand exports, given the country’s small global  market share, for which a number of supportive initiatives were being implemented in trade  facilitation and infrastructure, including the development of coastal employment zones. The  authorities underscored their commitment to an open trade regime, noting that once agricultural  products are excluded, India’s tariffs were broadly comparable to those of other emerging market  peers. The authorities expressed concern that India is confronting rising non-tariff barriers in  export markets, though the country had refrained from increasing import restrictions except for  anti-dumping measures.  
E. Structural Policies to Boost Growth and Employment  
44. India has made considerable  progress on both the pace and the  composition of reforms. While the pace of  reform has decelerated for most of the  countries presented in OECD’s responsiveness  indicator, India was one of a few countries to

range of important reforms, particularly fiscal,  monetary and financial, as well as trade and  factor market reforms (see Annex I).  
Advanced economies Emerging economies Source: OECD  Note: OECD produces a reform responsiveness indicator that measures the extent of reform in five broad  areas: (i) product and labor market regulations, (ii) human capital formation, (iii) tax and benefits systems,  (iv) trade and investment regulation, and (v) innovation policies. The reform responsiveness indicator reflects  the share of policy recommendations from OECD's ""Going for Growth"" reports on which the country has  taken significant action.  
45. Among the long agenda of reforms, labor market reforms should take increasing  priority. The reform agenda includes addressing long-standing supply bottlenecks, labor and  product market reforms, and improving the business climate.26 A comprehensive package of  structural reforms remains the preferred approach, with priority given to labor market reforms to  facilitate greater and better quality job creation, and enhance the impact of recent product market  reforms. Building on recent progress, key necessary measures include:  
26 See IMF India Article IV Staff Reports of 2014, 2015 and 2016 for additional details. Such policy priorities for  India have also been identified in the OECD 2016 report Going for Growth.  
22 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  
INDIA 
· Labor market reforms. Greater labor market flexibility and product market competition remain  essential to create jobs and raise growth. More specifically, reforms to the Industrial Disputes Act  (IDA) of 1947—which requires firms employing 100 or more workers to obtain government  permission for layoffs, retrenchments, and closures—along with reforms to various restrictive  clauses under the Factories Act of 1948, are key. In addition, reducing the numbers of labor laws,  currently numbering around 250 at central and state level (these govern different aspects of the  labor market such as minimum wages, resolution of industrial disputes, conditions for hiring and  firing workers, and conditions for the closure of establishments), is also essential. Such reforms are  key to increasing the employment of women, broadening the manufacturing base, and taking  advantage of India’s favorable demographics by increasing employment in the formal sector of  the economy. They are also of highest priority from a sequencing perspective, as they can enhance  the positive impact of other structural reforms, strengthen the effectiveness of macroeconomic  policy, and also help boost ongoing economic recovery (see Selected Issues Chapter VII).  
· Land reforms. Streamlining and expediting land acquisition and simplification of procedures, at  both the center and state levels, remain a priority, including to facilitate and expedite infrastructure  development.  
· Power reforms. Building on the UDAY scheme for state power distribution companies, the policy  focus should now switch to implementing measures to improve the operational efficiency of the  state power distribution companies, including reducing transmission losses and raising power  tariffs when needed. Energy price reforms should consider regulatory policies for reducing fossil  fuel use in India, including to aid achievement of India’s climate change commitments (see  Selected Issues Chapter VIII).  
· Gender-focused reforms. Improvements in infrastructure—such as wider sanitation coverage,  easier access to roads and drinking water—that lower females’ home care burden are key to  increasing India’s female labor force participation that will help India achieve its economic  
growth potential (see Box 6). Moreover,  making amendments to and strengthening  90

· Strengthening the business climate. Both Union and state governments are making strong  efforts to improve India’s business climate, and these should continue. In particular, staff  
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 23 
INDIA 
welcomes the authorities’ efforts to improve India’s ranking on the World Bank’s Doing  Business indicators, particularly in the underperforming areas of resolving insolvency and  enforcing contracts. Staff supports the recent introduction of state-based doing business  indicators, which will continue to encourage cross-state competition in attracting domestic  and foreign investment (see Selected Issues Chapter XI).  
46. Agricultural sector reforms remain a policy priority for the Government, but the  pace of implementation has been slow. The agricultural sector contributes around 15 percent  of India’s GDP, and provides employment for about half of the Indian labor force. Some of the  recent agricultural policy initiatives undertaken by the Modi Government include: the assured  irrigation initiative under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana launched in July 2015; the  comprehensive crop insurance scheme Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana launched in February  2016; and the common electronic trading platform for National Agriculture Market (e-NAM)  launched in April 2016, which aims to integrate 585 wholesale markets across India by March,  2018. These arrangements are expected to reduce production risk and improve the  competitiveness of agricultural markets.  
47. While these agricultural policy measures are welcome, much more needs to be done  to address inherent long-term structural bottlenecks and help ease food inflation pressures. Building on recent progress, key measures should include:  
· Food procurement reforms. The reforms should include a revamp of government procurement  processes and the public distribution system (PDS) for food. While the system of minimum  support prices (backed by assured procurement) can help stabilize markets during periods of  weak production or excess supply, it should be limited to correcting market failures. Past hikes  in procurement prices for rice and wheat, combined with the government’s massive cereal  stockpiling, have resulted in market distortions (including a shortfall in the production of  legumes) and episodes of high food inflation. Implementing the recommendations of the  Shanta Kumar High Level Committee (HLC) on restructuring the role of the Food Corporation  of India (FCI)—including outsourcing of cereal procurement and stocking operations currently  under the FCI to the states and various agencies; better price support for pulses and oilseeds;  introducing cash transfers; and setting up vigilance committees to check leakages in the  PDS—would improve the efficiency of the entire food grain management system.27 
· Reforms to the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) and state-level Agricultural Produce Marketing  Committee (APMC) Act. These Acts are the key regulatory pillars empowering the central and  state governments to regulate and control production, distribution, marketing and pricing of  commodities identified as essential for consumers. While the intention of these Acts was to  ensure that farmers were offered fair and transparent prices, it has led to multiple market  intermediaries operating between the farmer and the consumer leading to market price  manipulations, and higher prices for consumers while farmers continue to receive meager  returns (see Selected Issues Chapter XII). Reforms pertaining to marketing in agriculture, in  line with NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog’s recommendations to  
27 See 2016 India Article IV Staff Report and Shanta Kumar Committee Report on FCI Reforms and Food Security. 
24 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  
INDIA 
liberalize markets by giving farmers more flexibility in the distribution and marketing of their  produce, will help raise the competitiveness, efficiency and transparency in state agriculture  markets.28 
· Subsidized water and other agricultural inputs. The government provides subsidies to the  agriculture sector through free or cheap water, electricity and fertilizers. This has had a large  negative impact on ground-water levels, soil fertility and production efficiency for both inputs  and outputs in agriculture. Input subsidies to farmers should be administered through direct  cash transfers rather than underpricing of agricultural inputs, in accordance with the  recommendations of the Kumar HLC, and be directed towards small-scale farmers.  
Authorities’ Views 
48. The authorities highlighted the progress made in facilitating investments in road,  power and coal sectors, furthering their important reform agenda, and expressed a strong  commitment to continue strengthening public service delivery and enhancing the business  environment. They highlighted the significant gains in targeted delivery of services through  application of Direct Benefit Transfer to flagship welfare schemes and subsidy programs. They  expected that the ongoing shift toward a systematic evaluation and monitoring of outcomes,  rather than inputs and processes, would deliver improvements in the quality and effectiveness of  public policies and services. At the level of states, the publication and ranking of policy outcomes  was generating reform momentum through cross-state competition and dissemination of best  practices. The authorities pointed to ongoing reform efforts in many priority areas. Labor market  reforms were most effectively pursued at the level of states, with a few states already enacting  such reforms. In their view, the objective should be to expand labor reforms to a critical mass of  states with a strong manufacturing base. In the agricultural sector, the authorities noted that pilot  programs are underway to rationalize fertilizer subsidies, while the Union government is working  with state governments to integrate agricultural markets across the country.  
F. Other Issues  
49. Macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance but improvements  are needed in several areas. Priority should be given to developing price indices suitable for  deriving volume estimates for key economic activities in the national accounts and updating the  index of industrial production, particularly given its use in compiling national accounts statistics. In  addition, efforts to back-cast the revised national accounts should be stepped up. There is also  scope to improve the timely reporting and dissemination of fiscal performance of the states. The  authorities should take advantage of the impending establishment of SARTTAC to obtain  technical assistance in enhancing the quality of Indian national accounts statistics.  
28 In October 2016, NITI Aayog launched an index to rank states based on initiatives taken by them in  implementing farm sector reforms. The index ranges from a score of 0 (no reforms at all) to 100 (complete  implementation of reforms) and is based on three major parameters—reforms in agriculture marketing, land  reforms, and reforms related to agro-forestry. While Maharashtra achieved the highest rank (with a score of 82),  almost two thirds of India’s 29 states have made slow progress with an index score below 50. 
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 25 
INDIA 
STAFF APPRAISAL  
50. The Indian economy has recorded strong growth in the past few years, helped by  terms of trade gains, implementation of key structural reforms, and reduced external  vulnerabilities. A halving of global oil prices, sound macroeconomic management, and  continuous efforts to tackle supply-side bottlenecks have been key to India’s ongoing growth  recovery and macroeconomic stability. Despite a weak global environment, the important  structural reforms initiated over the past two years will help India continue to stand out among  the world’s fastest growing EMs.  
51. While the medium-term growth outlook remains favorable, the economy faces near term challenges. In FY2017/18 economic growth is expected to rebound from a temporary  slowdown caused by the currency exchange initiative, which is adversely affecting private  consumption, the key growth driver of the past few years. The investment recovery is expected to  remain modest and uneven across sectors as deleveraging continues and industrial capacity  utilization picks up. The balance of risks is tilted to the downside. A key downside risk is the  currency exchange initiative which will likely have medium-term positive benefits in curtailing tax  evasion, but may have a larger-than-anticipated negative impact on the economy in the near term  through weaker private consumption. Additional risks include renewed global market volatility,  uncertainty in design and implementation of the GST, and continued weak corporate and public  bank balance sheets. Prominent upside risks include lower-for-longer energy prices and enhanced  investor confidence accompanying structural reforms.  
52. Action is needed to quickly restore cash in circulation and avoid payment  disruptions. The authorities should continue to enhance the supply of new banknotes, and if  needed consider extending or expanding targeted temporary exemptions, including on use of old  banknotes, particularly for rural and remote areas. While the financial system is expected to  weather the currency exchange-induced temporary growth slowdown, the authorities should  remain vigilant given the potential further build-up of NPAs and elevated corporate sector  vulnerabilities, and ensure prudent support to the economic sectors affected by the currency  exchange initiative.  
53. Despite a strong policy push for balance sheet clean up, elevated corporate sector  vulnerabilities continue to pose risks to the soundness of public banks. While India’s financial  system is generally sound, the RBI should continue to ensure full recognition of non-performing  assets on banks’ balance sheets and increase provisioning requirements as needed. The successful  implementation of the AQR process, the new bankruptcy code, and additional debt recovery  mechanisms will bridge critical gaps in the resolution of bank asset quality distress and enhance  financial stability. Augmenting capital buffers in public banks, strengthening the NPA resolution  regime and public sector bank governance reform, as well as further measures to develop  corporate debt markets, are key to enhancing the financial system’s ability to contribute to  growth. India’s strong efforts in enhancing financial inclusion should continue to be facilitated by  new technologies and greater use of electronic payment technologies. 
26 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  
INDIA 
54. Monetary policy credibility has strengthened, yet achieving a low and stable rate of  inflation in the medium-term hinges on further supply-side reforms and continued fiscal  consolidation. The recent formalization of the flexible inflation targeting regime and formation of  the Monetary Policy Committee provide the institutional foundation for strong monetary policy  credibility. The current monetary policy setting is consistent with inflation remaining within the  RBI’s medium-term inflation target band. However, inflation is likely to remain in the upper half of  the target band over the medium-term, mainly due to food supply constraints and sticky  household inflation expectations. Monetary policy should continue to be supported by fiscal  consolidation and agricultural reform measures to boost food supplies.  
55. The authorities should press ahead with their longer-term objective of substantially  reducing fiscal deficits and the public debt burden. With continued delays in reaching  medium-term deficit targets, India’s public debt ratio is likely to remain high and fiscal policy  space remains limited. Implementation of a robust GST, given its growth enhancing effects, and  further subsidy reforms should be key pillars of the authorities’ fiscal consolidation strategy.  Building on their recent success in fuel subsidy reforms and efforts to enhance financial inclusion,  the authorities should continue to pursue better targeting and greater efficiency of subsidy and  social spending programs through use of direct benefit transfers. To prevent pro-cyclicality of  fiscal policy and safeguard the quality of fiscal adjustment in the future, fiscal consolidation needs  to be accompanied by strengthening of fiscal responsibility and medium-term expenditure and  budget frameworks for both the Union government and the states. In the revised fiscal  responsibility framework, the authorities should consider anchoring the deficit path by a medium term public debt target, complemented by a nominal expenditure growth rule. Fiscal  consolidation will enable a gradual phasing-out of financial repression, which will help price  stability and lower the cost of credit for the private sector.  
56. Boosting exports and further enhancing the environment for attracting stable  capital flows are key challenges. India’s external position remains broadly consistent with  fundamentals and the level of international reserves is assessed to be adequate. Nonetheless,  continued vigilance is needed given potential external shocks and global financial market  volatility. Exchange rate flexibility should remain the main shock absorber and could be  accompanied by judicious foreign exchange intervention given India’s increased reserve buffers.  As the external environment remains weak, the need to reduce trade barriers and support trade  liberalization has become even more pressing. Continued efforts to revamp the business climate  remain necessary to attract even greater FDI flows and help ensure the success of the “Make in  India” initiative.  
57. Notwithstanding considerable progress made in the past two years, advancing  structural reforms remains essential for creating jobs and raising growth. Labor market reforms  should be at the top of India’s to-do list, given their ability to enhance the impact of recent product  market reforms, and help increase formal sector employment and the employment of women.  Improvements in infrastructure, including wider sanitation coverage, are key to raising India’s female  labor force participation and potential growth. Strong efforts to improve India’s business climate and  to leverage and empower cross-state regulatory and economic competition will also help raise both

foreign and domestic investment. Finally, much more needs to be done to address long-standing  structural bottlenecks and enhance market efficiency in the agricultural sector, which if successful  would help raise food availability and consumption, enhance returns to farmers, and support  macroeconomic stability by dampening food inflation pressures.  
58. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12- month cycle.

Box 1. Currency Withdrawal and Exchange and its Economic Impact1 
The Government of India withdrew the legal tender status of all existing Rs 500 and 1000  currency notes effective November 9, 2016, in a bid to nullify “black money” hoarded in cash,  address tax evasion, tackle counterfeiting, and curb financing of terrorism. The initiative affected  notes with a total value of about Rs 15 trillion (about 86 percent of all cash in circulation). Defunct notes  could be deposited in unlimited amounts into bank accounts until end-2016, with large deposits (US$  4000 and above) expected to attract scrutiny of the tax authorities. At the time of the withdrawal, the  roll out of a new series of Rs 500 and 2000 notes was announced, but distribution of new currency notes  has proceeded slowly. Cash exchanges of defunct notes were allowed initially up to Rs 4,500 (US$ 70)  but were later discontinued. Caps have been imposed on cash withdrawals by individuals and  corporations from their bank accounts, while check and electronic payments remain unaffected. As  disruptions to payments arose, several temporary exemptions were granted to ease the cash crunch.  The exemptions aimed at easing transactions in some public offices and for the farming sector, as well  as making payments for public utility services and purchasing key primary products. In this regard, the  success of the initiative also depends on the effective implementation of AML/CFT safeguards,  particularly in the banking sector and the gold market.  
Payment transactions in India are primarily cash-based and electronic payments infrastructure is  limited. At end-2015, currency in circulation in India stood at about 12 percent of GDP, one of the  
highest levels among countries covered in the Bank for  International Settlements’ Committee on Payments and  Market Infrastructure. Cash accounted for about three  quarters of the narrow money base, as a large number of  households rely on cash for everyday transactions.

A decline in currency supply can  be calibrated as a temporary tightening of monetary  conditions, using previous money demand studies for

tightening of monetary conditions in the initial weeks of the initiative, which eases as currency is  replaced. Consequently, based on the IMF India Quarterly Projection Model, GDP growth is expected to  slow to about 6 percent in the second half of FY2016/17, before gradually rebounding in the course of  FY2017/18. An analysis of sectoral accounts that takes reliance on cash into account leads to similar  estimates of growth for FY2016/17 and FY2017/18.

Debt Restructuring for Power Distribution Companies1 
While improvements in fuel supply, electricity generation, and transmission capacity have  occurred in India in recent years, distribution has remained problematic and become the  weak link in the electricity supply chain. Electricity distribution in India occurs primarily through  inefficient and financially troubled state-owned power distribution companies (DISCOMs). The  DISCOMs experience operational losses2 for two main reasons: (i) aggregate technical and  commercial (AT&C) losses, a part of which are losses in the process of transmission and  distribution (T&D), and (ii) electricity tariffs that are low considering the cost of procuring power.  Despite improvement in the past decade, India’s T&D losses, at almost 20 percent of generation,  are among the highest levels of T&D losses in the world. DISCOMs have been funding operational  losses with debt carrying high interest rates, compounding their financial troubles.

In November 2015, the Government of India launched the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana,  or UDAY scheme, aimed at turning around the financially stressed and generally inefficient  state-owned DISCOMs.3 At the time, the DISCOMs had together accumulated about Rs 3.8  trillion in losses (3 percent of then-GDP) and Rs 4.3 trillion in debt (3.4 percent of GDP) with  interest rates as high as 15 percent. Financial losses are concentrated in several states, with losses  of the worst seven states accounting for almost 90 percent of total losses.

2 Aggregate technical losses refer to losses as power is transmitted through the distribution system, while  commercial losses result from theft of electricity or deficiencies in metering.  
3 UDAY plans a four-pronged approach to helping the DISCOMs recover and become more efficient by: (i)  Improving operational efficiencies of DISCOMs; (ii) Reducing the cost of power; (iii) Reducing the interest cost of  DISCOMs; and (iv) Enforcing financial discipline on DISCOMs by aligning their finances with state finances.

Box 2. Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY): 
Debt Restructuring for Power Distribution Companies (Concluded) 
The key feature of the scheme is the restructuring of DISCOM debt, whereby states that join  the scheme take over 75 percent of their DISCOMs’ outstanding debt as of September 2015— 50 percent in FY2015/16 and 25 percent in 2016/17—funded by issuing state bonds in the market  or directly to the banks originally holding the DISCOM debt. These ‘UDAY bonds’ would not count  towards states’ FRBMA prescribed borrowing limits of 3 percent of gross state domestic product  (GSDP). For the remaining 25 percent of outstanding DISCOM debt, the holding banks would  convert the debt to loans with lower interest rate, i.e. not more than the bank’s base rate plus 10  basis points. Finally, with respect to the future financial losses of DISCOMs, states would gradually  take over and fund the losses.4 These future losses would count towards the state deficit limits,  thereby giving states incentive to ensure an improvement in operations at DISCOMs to prevent  future financial losses.  
A critical mass of states has joined UDAY and restructured the DISCOM debt, relieving the  financial stress of these DISCOMs. As of November 2016, nine states had issued UDAY bonds  amounting to Rs 1,585 billion (or 50 percent of DISCOM debt eligible for the scheme). Six  additional states and one Union territory have signaled their intention to join the scheme, by  signing a tripartite agreement between the Centre, the state government and the DISCOM,  committing to a significant improvement in operations and thus financial performance.5  
The focus should now turn to stronger reforms aimed at improving operational efficiency,  which is critical to the success of UDAY. While the DISCOMs have been bailed out by state  governments in the past,6 UDAY places additional focus on improving operational efficiency,  decreasing the cost of purchasing power, and enabling quarterly increases in electricity tariffs.7 In  addition, measures to increase billing efficiency and decrease commercial losses will be necessary.  
4 That is, they would take over 5 percent of the FY2017/18 losses in FY2018/19, 10 percent of the FY2018/19 losses  the following year, 25 percent of the FY2019/20 losses the following year, and 50 percent of the FY2020/21 losses  the following year.  
5 In total, the 15 states and Union territory account for almost 60 percent of outstanding DISCOM debt.  
6 The previous Scheme for Financial Restructuring of the State Distribution Companies was launched in October  2012. Under that scheme, DISCOMs were supposed to issue 50 percent of their short-term liabilities as state backed bonds, which would then be taken over by state government over the next 2-5 years, while remaining  within the borrowing ceilings prescribed by their respective FRBMAs. The remaining 50 percent of the DISCOMs’  short-term liabilities were to be rescheduled by lenders, with the principal and interest backed by state  government guarantees. Eight states, then accounting for the majority of accumulated losses, joined the scheme.  But the debt burden of the DISCOMS was not sufficiently eased as the states did not have enough room to take  over the debt and, in addition, most DISCOMs did not end up meeting the requisite performance criteria.  
7 The MoUs discuss states improving operating parameters and raising power tariffs to bring them in line with  costs. As incentive, states that reach certain operational milestones will be offered additional funding to facilitate  augmentation of distribution networks, as well as be supported with additional coal and additional low cost power  from NTPC (the largest electricity generation company) and other central public sector electricity companies.

Box 3. Developing India’s Corporate Bond Market1  
India’s corporate bond market has expanded rapidly in recent years but remains a limited  source of funding, with firms relying predominantly on bank credit. The local corporate  securities market, particularly commercial paper (CPs), have been playing a growing role in  corporate funding. Both issuance volumes and issues have expanded considerably, with issuance  volumes roughly doubling to Rs 5.8 billion in the five years to end-FY2016, and outstanding debt  reaching close to 15 percent of GDP at end-FY2016 (Figure). However, domestic debt securities  still account for only about 20 percent of corporate funding (Figure). The market faces various  structural impediments, including: (i) dominance of issuances by financial sector entities; (ii)  prevalence of private placements; (iii) very limited market liquidity; and (iv) restrictions on  institutional-investor allocations to non-investment-grade bonds. Corporate funding has so far  largely been supported by bank credit and external borrowing, which jointly accounted for more  than 80 percent of funding at end-FY2016. However, the relatively high dependence on external  funding exposes Indian corporates to potential debt repayment difficulties. Coupled with credit  supply pressures due to the PSBs’ asset quality problems, the lack of sufficient long-term funding  channels can impair growth and infrastructure development, particularly in view of India’s high  capital funding requirements.2  
The growing need to support further corporate bond market development has prompted  the Indian authorities to undertake a comprehensive reform plan. The measures, drafted by  the inter-agency Working Group on Development of Corporate Bond Market in India (chaired by  Deputy Governor Khan of the Reserve Bank of India) and announced in August 2016 entail key  reforms, including: (i) a much needed emphasis on inter-agency coordination in supporting and  regulating the market; (ii) development of key missing markets, including the corporate repo  market; (iii) support for extension of partial credit enhancements (PCEs)—via a considerable  increase in the aggregate bank cap (to 50 percent)—to open avenues for less creditworthy  borrowers to tap markets; (iv) enhancement of market liquidity via the sanctioning of corporate  bond reissuance under the same ISIN and hence higher volumes for secondary trading; (v) steps  towards ensuring uniform valuations; and (vi) rationalization of stamp duties across states.

Box 3. Developing India’s Corporate Bond Market (Concluded)  
The plan’s publication has been followed by implementation steps by relevant regulators (notably RBI and Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)) to boost incentives for use of  market funding (via an increase of the PCE cap, and introduction of banks’ large exposure limits);  expand market participation (by permitting brokers in the corporate repo market and foreign  investor direct trading in corporate bonds); and introducing and Electronic Dealing Platform in the  corporate repo market). Finally, in a move to ensure market transparency, the National Stock  Exchange of India (NSE) introduced a trade repository of primary- and secondary-market activities  at both over the counter markets and across exchanges.  
The new measures would remove key hurdles to the development of the Indian corporate  bond market, but would also require addressing important constraints, including:  
· High leverage, particularly among large corporates, is likely to dampen issuance, at least in  the short term. The encouragement of corporate funding “through market mechanism” via  the introduction of limits banks’ large exposures under the new measures should shift  funding away from banks and towards the debt market in the medium to long term.  However, a comprehensive strategy of corporate debt restructuring is critical to help  unlock funding demand and spur investment in the economy. 
· The domestic investor base remains limited and would benefit from better risk transfer  mechanisms. Recent measures on liberalizing restrictions on foreign bond holdings—  including the opening up of foreign portfolio investment (FPI) in unlisted securities under  the authorities’ plan and the easing of FPI investment limits—are conducive to bringing in  much-needed foreign investment. However, domestic insurance companies and pension  funds, typically instrumental in absorbing demand for corporate paper in well-developed  corporate markets, still play a very limited role in the market. Further efforts to develop  better risk transfer mechanisms, including the dormant CDS market, would boost  institutional investors’ incentives to finance riskier corporates.  
· A successful implementation would benefit from effective cross-agency coordination. Both  the RBI and SEBI have acted swiftly to implement key elements of the new plan. However,  it is important to ensure that all relevant agencies—including the Government of India,  RBI, SEBI, Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA),  Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), and the Pension Fund  Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA)—follow through and coordinate on  implementation.

Box 4. Financial Inclusion in India: Recent Initiatives and Policy Priorities1 
Overcoming limited access to adequate and formal finance for a wide spectrum of Indian  households and small and micro-sized businesses is a formidable challenge. Bank penetration stood at 35  
percent in 2011, which is low compared to many emerging  market economies, and use of financial services has been  minimal. Moreover, in 2014 the account dormancy rate

exceeded 40 percent, only 11 percent of those who had a

70 
loans (World Bank, 2014). Informal finance has played an  
60 
important role in funding small-scale and informal business,

including in agriculture, and has often entailed predatory  30

Recent financial sector initiatives have seen some success  in enhancing various aspects of financial inclusion, yet  challenges remain. While more than 240 million previously

on unbanked households, the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA3 Yojana 40 
(PMMY) scheme launched in January 2016, aims to enable  30 
access to formal finance for micro, small and medium-sized  20 
business by providing collateral-free loans. Close to one  percent of GDP in loans have been disbursed under this

scheme, of which over one-third of loans have been extended

finance. Such business accounted for about one-half of the total amount lent under the scheme, and about four fifths of the number of loans, in part reflecting scheme’s support to new business undertakings led by women.  
Staff analysis indicates that increasing access to affordable formal finance can raise output and improve  gender equality. Using a two-sector general equilibrium model incorporating formal and informal sources of  finance, staff estimates show that policies that an increase in womens’ access to formal finance improves gender  equality in entrepreneurship, which in turn boosts female labor force participation and employment, leading to  higher consumption and GDP (see Selected Issues Chapter IX).  
While policies should continue to focus on the supply of finance, addressing constraints on the demand  for formal finance should be prioritized. Strengthening financial literacy programs, holding workshops aimed  at building the trust of rural communities with the banking system, and conducting surveys to understand the  costs and barriers to usage of formal financial services, would help promote inclusion. In addition, technology driven initiatives, spanning know-your-customer, mobile banking, digitalization and greater usage of direct  benefit transfer schemes can help lower transaction costs. The government should measure the success of its  interventions by the extent of reduction in informal employment, the rise in formal entrepreneurship and the  extent of mobility of firms to medium and large sizes.

Box 5. Goods and Services Tax1 
The passage by the Indian Parliament of the long-awaited Goods and Services Tax (GST)  Constitutional Amendment is a landmark achievement. Proposals for a pan-India value-added  tax have been under discussion for several decades. As the consensus grew for moving to a  national level GST to be shared by the center and the states, the FY2006/07 Budget proposed a  timeframe for GST introduction for the first time. However, since the Indian Constitution  precluded the center from taxing sales and empowered it with the exclusive right to tax services, a  “grand bargain” between the center and states was necessary to enable taxation of sales by the  center in exchange for a share of GST revenues to the states. This had remained elusive until  August 2016 when the Constitutional Amendment Bill was passed. The Constitution was amended  shortly thereafter, in September 2016, after a majority of state legislatures ratified the Bill and a  GST Council was set-up to draft detailed GST laws. Several steps towards GST implementation,  which the government hopes to introduce by April 2017, now remain. First, detailed GST laws  must be drafted and passed by the Indian Parliament for the center and by each state legislature  for the states. Second, the IT infrastructure needs to be completed and tax officers and industry  professionals trained. 
The GST should help secure gains in economic efficiency and growth, with favorable effects  on investment and exports. The GST will replace a plethora of cascading center, state, inter state, and local taxes with a single, nationwide, value-added tax on goods and services. The  destination-based GST will create, for the first time, a single Indian market, and will greatly  enhance India as an investment destination. By subsuming most of the existing indirect taxes,  such as excise, sales and services levies, the indirect tax structure of the country will become less  complex and the cost of doing business will decline. Export competitiveness will rise as logistical  costs fall with the removal of interstate tax-induced trade barriers, the tax system becomes more  efficient, and use is made of input tax credits on cross-state trade. The GST will also raise general  government tax collection, including by fostering compliance and help ensure a decline in the  share of the informal sector. Consequently, it can also support fiscal consolidation efforts which, in  addition to economic efficiency gains, should solidify recent monetary policy strides in achieving  low and stable inflation in the medium-term. 
In the steps that remain towards implementing the GST, ensuring a robust design is key. With the GST Council in place and resolutions reached on the tax brackets, compensation to states, and turnover thresholds, decisions are still to be made on classification of goods and  services across tax brackets as well as details of exemptions. There are a couple of key  macroeconomic issues to be considered. First, the GST should have uniform cross-state rates, a  simple tax rate structure, and minimal exemptions. With the JAM (Jan Dhan Yojana bank accounts,  Aadhaar identification, mobile banking) trinity in place, the policy focus should be on enhancing  the distributional aspects of fiscal spending that a higher tax rate can enable, rather than  supporting the poor through reduced and potentially distortionary tax rates. Second, key  production inputs, such as energy and real estate, should be kept within the tax base to enable  greater output gains and reduce the tax burden across sectors. Output losses from production  inefficiencies due to cascading embodied in exemptions may be large even under a fairly low  nominal tax rate and with relatively few stages of production.2

Box 6. Key Structural Reform: Economic Impact of Poor Sanitation in India1 
India was not able to achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of halving the share  of the population without basic sanitation by end-2015. At the national level, the targeted reduction  in this share from 76 percent in 1990 to 38 percent by 2015 was missed by about 11 percentage points.  According to the Census 2011 survey, 53.1 percent (63.6 percent in 2001) of households in India do not  have a toilet, with the percentage being as high as 69.3 percent (78.1 percent in 2001) in rural areas and  18.6 percent (26.3 percent in 2001) in urban areas. However, since water supply and sanitation is a state  responsibility under the Indian Constitution, there is wide variation in sanitation coverage across various  states, where some states did achieve their respective

Box 6. Key Structural Reform: Economic Impact of Poor Sanitation in India (Concluded)  
As well, the World Bank’s Water and Sanitation Program  335368912072
(WSP) has pegged the economic cost of inadequate  
sanitation at around 6.4 per cent of India’s GDP in 2006.  
Sanitation should be enhanced through infrastructure  
investment, as well as promoting health awareness  
and facilitating offtake. While sanitation coverage and  
infrastructure have been increasing, survey and studies  
indicate that the use of existing toilets in both rural and  
urban areas remains low. Along with inadequate  
infrastructure, cultural and traditional barriers and a lack  
of knowledge of health risks have been brought forward  
as the prime reasons behind demand side constraints  
(NSS 69th round). In this regard, the Swachh Bharat (Clean  
India) mission,5 launched in October 2014 alongside  
improving sanitation infrastructure, also focuses on fostering large-scale social and behavior change to  increase sanitation demand in both rural and urban India. Since the launch of the program, close to 31  million toilets have been built in rural areas, resulting in a 17.5 percent increase in the number of Indian  
rural households with a latrine facility. The relatively large fiscal cost of the Swachh Bharat program  (estimated at about ¼ of one percent of GDP over the next 5 years) have been supported through  introduction of a 0.5 percent special cess on services.6 That said, given the diverse range of cultures,  languages and religion within India means that the role of the central government can be rather limited.  Hence, to enable greater impact, policy interventions should continue to be tailored to community specific factors, across particular states and districts.

Although there has been a rise in awareness,  advances in technology and an increase in  literacy levels, India’s child sex ratio  (number of girls per 1000 boys) continues to  decline. According to the 2011 census, with  just 918 girls per 1000 boys in the 0-6 years age  group, the child sex ratio (CSR) has reached its  lowest level since India’s first census of 1951,  down from 927 girls per 1000 boys in 2001 and  from 945 girls in 1991.2 While India’s overall sex  ratio for the entire population improved to 943  females per 1000 males from 933 in 2001, a  declining CSR poses a risk to the future overall  share of women in the population.

This scheme relies on increasing awareness and  better implementation of existing schemes such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All  Movement), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (National Mission for Secondary Education)  and the Integrated Child Development Scheme to make the initiative a success.5In addition, a  financial incentive through the small savings scheme—Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana6—whereby an  account in the name of a girl child can be opened (and receive a favorable interest rate of  9.1 percent), is an associated scheme, with the aim of providing financial independence and  insurance to girls when they turn 18 years of age.

Increasing engagement at the state level,  
(Age group 0-6 years)
deepening community participation and  
long-term growth-supporting policies will  
help the success of the Beti Bachao Beti  
Padhao scheme. There exists a cross-state 
disparity in the implementation and target  
realization of various Union government-led  
programs, which undermines the objectives of  
such schemes (Figure). With more autonomy in  
states’ spending decisions owing to higher tax  
devolution, combined with a cut in Union  
Budget allocation for these programs7, there is a  
need to strengthen coordination and  
participation across states to more equally

prioritize spending on schemes with an intended  
impact on the wellbeing of the girl child. Furthermore, a more holistic policy approach oriented  towards higher growth, job creation, and financial inclusion will lead to better sex ratios in the  long run. In addition, reorienting public expenditure towards broadening the social safety net will  reduce the dependence of the old on their children, which will thereby help equalize the  preference for girls and boys.

Annex I. Key Policy Actions 2016–171 
Monetary Policy  
March 3, 2016 Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR): RBI notified  guidelines for MCLR for commercial banks effective April 1, 2016. MCLR  
would replace ‘base rate’ as the new reference point for setting lending rates  for various tenures based on marginal cost of funds (= 92 percent x marginal  cost of borrowings + 8 percent x return on net worth). Banks are now  
required to review and publish MCLR on a monthly basis based on changes in  deposit rates, thus supporting quicker transmission of monetary policy moves.  April 5, 2016 Policy actions: 
(i) Reduced repo rate by 25 bps to 6.50 percent from 6.75 percent;  
(ii) Narrowed the policy rate corridor from +/-100 bps to +/- 50 bps by  
reducing the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate by 75 bps and  
increasing the reverse repo rate by 25 bps. Consequently, the reverse  
repo rate was adjusted to 6.0 per cent, and MSF rate to 7.0 percent;  
(iii) Progressively lower the average ex ante liquidity deficit in the system  
from one percent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) to a position  
closer to neutrality; and supply of durable liquidity to be smoothened  
over the year through open market operation (OMOs);  
(iv) Reduced the minimum daily maintenance of cash reserve ratio (CRR)  
from 95 percent of the requirement to 90 percent, while keeping the CRR  
unchanged at 4.0 percent of NDTL.  
May 14, 2016 Flexible Inflation Targeting & Monetary Policy Committee (MPC): Government amended RBI Act, 1934 to include flexible inflation targeting (FIT)  as the new operational framework for the central bank and notified the  
factors that would constitute failure to achieve the inflation target, namely: (a)  average inflation remains more than the upper tolerance level of the inflation  target notified for any three consecutive quarters; or (b) average inflation  
remains less than the lower tolerance level of the inflation target notified for  any three consecutive quarters, whereby the RBI would be required to explain  factors responsible and spell out policy action.  
The amendment also provided for a six-member Monetary Policy Committee  (MPC), responsible for setting monetary policy. MPC would have three  
members from the RBI, including the Governor, the ex-officio chairperson, the  Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy and one executive director and  three outside experts to be appointed by the government for a period of 4  years and not eligible for re-appointment. Each member would have one vote  and in the case of a tie, the Governor would have a second or casting vote.  
August 5, 2016 Inflation target: Based on the amended RBI Act 1934 the government  notified the CPI headline inflation target band for a five-year period ending  March 31, 2021 to be 4 +/- 2 percent.  
September 30,  2016 
Monetary policy committee (MPC) formation: Government notified the  formation of a six-member MPC which includes Dr. Urjit Patel, Governor  RBI, Chairperson, Mr. R. Gandhi, Deputy Governor, RBI, Dr. Michael Patra,  Executive Director, RBI, Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical

February 28,  2016  
Oil Bonds: RBI allowed oil bonds issued by the government to qualify as  eligible securities for repos, reverse repos and Marginal Standing Facility  (MSF), while non-statutory liquidity requirement (SLR) status of these bonds  would continue.  
Cash reserve ratio (CRR): RBI asked banks to maintain an incremental CRR of  100 percent on the increase in net demand and time liabilities (NDTL)  between September 16, 2016 and November 11, 2016, effective from  November 26, 2016. The hike is a temporary measure to offset deposits  resulting from the withdrawing of legal tender of old <U+20B9>500 and <U+20B9>1000  currency notes in circulation.  
Financial Sector  
Banks Board Bureau (BBB): With a view to improve governance of public  sector banks (PSBs), the government set up an autonomous Banks Board  Bureau, responsible for selection of heads of PSBs and financial institutions,  and help develop strategies and capital raising plans.  
March 17, 2016 Framework for Revival and Rehabilitation of Micro, Small and Medium  Enterprises (MSMEs): RBI notified changes to the framework for MSME  
stressed assets up to loan size of <U+20B9>250 million which would require every bank  to form special committees at district/regional level to help regularize assets  before turning into NPAs. Operationally banks would be required to  
categorize stressed assets into three sub-categories under the Special  
Mention Account (SMA) – SMA-0, SMA-1 and SMA-2 depending on duration  of default on interest or/and principal.  
March 17, 2016 Currency Futures Market: RBI permitted stand-alone primary dealers (PDs)  to deal in currency futures contracts traded on recognized exchanges subject  to prudential eligibility criteria, position limits and risk management practices.

April 4, 2016 and July 5, 2016.  
March 30, 2016 External Commercial Borrowing (ECB): RBI allowed infrastructure  companies, Non-Banking Financial Companies-Infrastructure Finance  
Companies (NBFC-IFCs), NBFCs-Asset Finance Companies (NBFC-AFCs),  
Holding Companies and Core Investment Companies (CICs) to raise ECB with  minimum average maturity period of 5 years, subject to 100 percent hedging.  Further, exploration, mining and refinery sectors would be deemed as  
infrastructure sector, and be allowed access to ECB as applicable to the sector.  May 11, 2016 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Parliament passed the Insolvency  and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. The Code provides a 180-day time-bound  
insolvency resolution process for companies, partnerships and individuals.
62 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 
May 26, 2016 Strategic Debt Restructuring Mechanism for NBFCs: RBI issued fresh  guidelines asking NBFCs to implement the debt-restructuring package, under  the Joint Lender's Forum and multiple banking arrangements in 90 days, at  par with commercial banks.  
June 13, 2016 NPA resolution: RBI notified the Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of  Stressed Assets (S4A) as an optional framework for the resolution of large  
stressed accounts (more than <U+20B9>5 billion) by bifurcating outstanding debt into  two components: a sustainable portion (Part A) not less than 50% of total  
debt, and an unsustainable portion (Part B). While Part B portion would be  
classified as non-performing asset and appropriate enhanced provision be  
made, the sustainable portion (Part A) would be treated as ‘Standard’ upon  implementation of the resolution plan by the bank. Banks could upgrade Part  B to standard category and reverse the associated enhanced provisions after  one year of satisfactory performance of Part A loans. To ensure transparency  S4A scheme envisages the resolution plan be prepared by credible  
professional agencies and be reviewed by an Overseeing Committee, to be  set up by the Indian Banks Association (IBA), in consultation with the RBI.  
June 15, 2016 Bank consolidation: The government gave in-principle approval to a  proposal for the merger of five associate banks of the State Bank of India  
(SBI), the largest public sector bank, with itself along with the Bharatiya Mahila  Bank. SBI board has approved share swap ratio to merge five associate  
banks—the State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Travancore, State  Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Mysore and State Bank of Hyderabad.  
June 23, 2016 Over the Counter (OTC) currency options market: RBI permitted resident  exporters and importers of goods and services to write (sell) standalone plain  vanilla European call and put option contracts against their contracted  
exposure, i.e. covered call and covered put respectively.

August 1, 2016 On Tap Bank Licensing: RBI issued fresh guidelines for “on tap” licensing of  universal banks in the private sector which allow individuals, private sector  
entities and NBFCs to apply for banking license whenever they regard as  
appropriate. It replaced the earlier ‘Stop and Go’ licensing policy that  
depended on central bank’s discretion to invite applications. A fresh applicant  would need a minimum paid-up capital of <U+20B9>5 billion with the foreign  
investment limit pegged at 74 percent.  
August 25, 2016 Corporate bond market: 
(i) RBI raised the aggregate exposure limit for all banks toward partial credit  enhancement (PCE) of a given bond issue size to 50 percent from 20  
percent;  
(ii) Masala bonds by banks: RBI allowed banks to issue Perpetual Debt  
Instruments (PDI) qualifying for inclusion as Additional Tier 1 capital and  
debt capital instruments qualifying for inclusion as Tier 2 capital, by way  
of rupee-denominated (Masala) bonds overseas. It is also permitted  
banks to issue long term Masala bonds for financing infrastructure and  
affordable housing (notified on November 3, 2016);

Sanctioned Credit Limit (ASCL) effective FY 2017/18 and thereby nudging  corporates to access market instruments, viz., bonds, debentures,  redeemable preference shares and any other non-credit liability. Banks’  lending above the Normally permitted lending limit (NPLL), which is set  at 50 percent of the incremental funds raised by the specified borrower  over and above its ASCL would be treated as risky and invite higher risk  weights and provisioning.  
(iv) Allow FPIs to trade directly in corporate bonds without involving brokers;  (v) Amend RBI Act to accept corporate bonds under Liquidity Adjustment  Facility (LAF) of RBI;  
(vi) Permit corporates to lend through the repo market, without any tenor or  counterparty restrictions; and  
(vii) Permitted brokers registered with SEBI and authorized as market makers  in corporate bond market to undertake repo/reverse repo contracts in  corporate debt securities.

Key features are: (i) empowering the District Magistrate to  assist banks in taking over management of a company in default; (ii) allowing  secured creditors to take over collateral within 30 days; (iii) empowering RBI  to audit, inspect and regulate Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) and  remove the chairman or any director or impose penalties for non-compliance;  and (iv) exempt stamp duty on transactions undertaken for transfer of  financial assets (loans and collaterals) in favor of ARCs.  
Sale of Stressed Assets: RBI allowed banks to sell stressed assets to other  banks, NBFCs or financial institutions, who have the necessary capital and  expertise in resolving stressed assets.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) permitted commodity  exchanges to introduce trading in options, subject to its approval.  Resolution corporation: Government released the report of the  Committee to draft a Code on Resolution of Financial Firms, along with a  draft Bill for public comment. The draft Bill has provision for creating a  Resolution Corporation responsible for resolving insolvency of financial  firms; including banks, insurance companies, and non-banking financial  companies. The board of the corporation would have representatives of  key regulators, RBI, SEBI, IRDA, and the central government.  
The corporation would categorize financial firms’ risk profile as low,  moderate, material, imminent or critical by taking into account their  capital, asset quality, liquidity conditions; and the resolution process for  critical firms would have to be completed within two years, with an option  to extend by one year in special cases.

Investment by FPIs in Government Securities: The limits for investment  by FPIs were raised in two tranches: <U+20B9>100 billion each in central  government securities and <U+20B9>35 billion each in state development loans  (SDLs) from October 3, 2016 and January 2, 2017, respectively.  FPIs participation in government securities: RBI allowed FPIs to trade  government securities in the secondary market, through the primary  members of NDS-OM including the Web-module. 
Money market futures: RBI introduced Interest Rate Futures based on  any rupee-denominated money market interest rate or money market  instrument on SEBI authorized stock exchanges. The RBI had already  permitted introduction of futures based on the 91-day Treasury Bill. FPI investment in corporate bonds: RBI permitted FPI investment in  unlisted corporate debt securities and securitized debt instruments within  the prescribed investment limits, currently at <U+20B9>350 billion.  Fiscal Policy 
Strategic disinvestment: Government asked NITI Aayog to prepare a list of  central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) for strategic disinvestment—i.e., sale  of equity up to 50 percent, or above along with transfer of management  control. The NITI Aayog in June submitted its first list of loss-making CPSEs,  subdivided into two groups—one comprising those that could be closed and  the other where government could divest its stake. The government has since  approved many of NITI Aayog’s recommendations; on October 27, 2016  announcing it had agreed to close the loss making Hindustan Cables Limited,  Kolkata, HMT Tractor Division and strategic sale of many PSUs.  
March 18, 2016 Interest rates on various Small Savings Schemes (SSS): Government  notified to reset interest rates on various small savings schemes on a quarterly  instead of annual basis, based on the government security yields of the  
previous three months—this quarterly revision would significantly address the  concerns of commercial banks’ inability to reduce their deposit rates and help  support monetary policy transmission. Following the notification, interest  
rates for various SSS came down significantly.  
April 6, 2016 State fiscal deficit target: The central government accepted Fourteenth Finance Commission recommendations of a fiscal deficit threshold limit of 3  percent of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) for the states. This nominal  limit would also have year-to-year flexibility for an additional fiscal deficit of  maximum of 0.5 percent in any given year for states that have a favorable  
debt-to-GSDP ratio and interest payments-to-revenue receipts ratio in the  
previous two years.  
May 10, 2016 Double taxation avoidance treaty: India and Mauritius signed the Protocol  for amendment of the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and  the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital  gains. The Protocol tackles long-standing issues of treaty abuse and round  
tripping of funds, curbs revenue loss, prevents double non-taxation and  
streamlines the flow of investment. Existing investments have been grand 
fathered and would not be subject to capital gains taxation in India.  
May 17, 2016 FRBM review committee: Government constituted a five-member committee  to comprehensively review and give recommendations on the FRBM roadmap 
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 65 
INDIA 
for the future, including the need and feasibility of having a ‘fiscal deficit  
range’ rather than a point target and aligning it with credit cycle.  
July 1, 2016 Subsidy on kerosene: The government allowed state-owned oil companies  to raise the price of kerosene by 25 paise a liter each month to cut subsidy  burden. The government would also raise subsidized LPG cylinder price every  month. Beginning FY2016/17, government would bear the entire fuel subsidy  burden, ending the practice of shifting part of it to upstream oil companies.  
July 6, 2016 Committee to examine feasibility of a new commencement date for financial years: Government constituted a Committee to examine the  
desirability and feasibility of adopting a new commencement date.  
July 15, 2016 Public Financial Management System: The government implemented the  use of Public Financial Management System (PFMS), an end-to-end solution  for processing payments, tracking, monitoring, accounting, reconciliation and  reporting for all central sector schemes to help track fund releases, and  
monitor their utilization. 
July 26, 2016 Seventh Pay Commission: Government notified implementation of Seventh  Pay Commission award for central government employees, with an overall  
increase in pay & allowances by 23.55 percent. The total financial impact in  the FY2016/17 is estimated at <U+20B9>1,021 billion and an additional cost of <U+20B9>121  billion in arrears and of salary and pension for two months of FY2015/16.  
August 8, 2016 Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill, 2014: Parliament passed the long delayed constitutional amendment GST Bill 2014, that would provide the legal  platform for rolling out a uniform GST across the country and formation of a  single market. The Bill has since been ratified by more than half of the states,  and received Presidential assent on September 8, 2016.

GST council: Government notified the formation of the GST council and its  secretariat as per the new constitutional amendment Act 2016. The Finance  Minister of the central government would be its ex-officio chairman. The  Minister of state, in-charge of revenue along with the Minister in-charge of  finance or taxation or any other Minister nominated by each state  government would be its member. The council has had several meetings since  its formation to recommend policy guidelines on issues including: model GST  Laws; list of goods and services to be exempted; and GST rates.  
Merger of railway budget with the central government budget: Government approved the merger of railway budget with the central  government budget to bring in efficiency in resource allocation and facilitate  multimodal transport planning between highways, railways and inland  waterways. This process would also result in a net savings <U+20B9>50 billion to the  railways, while letting it retain financial autonomy to raise resources from  market to finance capital expenditure.  
Merger of Plan and Non-Plan classification in Budget and Accounts: Government approved the merger of Plan and Non-Plan classification in  budget and accounts from FY2017/18.  
Advancement of Budget presentation: The government advanced the date  of the Budget presentation by a month from the last day of February. The  process would help completion of Budget-related legislative business before  31st March, and enable various Ministries to better plan and execute schemes.

The Project is expected to facilitate the roll-out of  the GST; assist in extension of the single window interface for customs  clearances; and initiatives under Digital India and Ease of Doing Business. Voluntary disclosure of income: Government’s income declaration  scheme (IDS) 2016 allowed disclosure of ‘black money’ with a provision for  45 percent penalty on the disclosed amount closed successfully on  September 30, 2016. The scheme (with a four-month window) received  total disclosures of Rs 652.5bn (or 0.4 percent of GDP), potentially earning  tax revenue of Rs 294bn (0.2 percent of GDP).  
Tax amnesty scheme: Lok Sabha (Lower house) passed a new Income Tax  Amendment Bill that proposed to introduce a new amnesty scheme,  “Taxation and Investment Regime for Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana,  2016’ (PMGKY). Under this regime the government would impose a 50  percent levy (30 percent tax + 10 percent penalties + 33 percent Pradhan  Mantri Garib Kalyan Cess on 30 percent tax amount) on the voluntarily  undisclosed income deposited into bank accounts of individuals, following  the currency withdrawal and exchange initiative. The levy would be much  larger at 85 percent for those who did not disclose but were caught by tax  authorities.  
Structural Policy 
January 27, 2016 Public Private Partnership (PPP): Government approved a hybrid annuity  model under PPP for implementing highway projects, under which the  
government would finance 40 percent of the project cost as construction  
support to private developers through annuity payments over a period of  
time. The balance would be financed by the private developer.  
March 25, 2016 Aadhaar Act, 2016: Parliament passed the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 that legalized  the office of the Unique Identification Authority (UID) responsible for issuing  Aadhaar number-based biometrics of residents. These unique identity  
numbers will be used to provide for targeted delivery of subsidies and  
services and help reduce leakages under various government schemes. 
May 2, 2016 Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill, 2016: Parliament passed The Mines  and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2016 that allows  transfer of mining leases which have been granted through either an auction  process or any non-auction process to any eligible party.  
May 12, 2016 Ease of doing business: As a measure towards improving the ease of doing  business, the RBI delegated power to the Authorized Dealers Category-I Banks  to grant approvals for establishment of branch, liaison, and project offices by  foreign entities in sectors where 100 percent FDI is allowed. 
May 25, 2016 The National Capital Goods Policy, 2016: Government announced its capital  goods sector policy with an objective of creating an ecosystem for globally  
competitive capital goods sector focusing on four key areas: (i) to devise a  
long term, stable and rationalized tax and duty structure; (ii) create a 'Start-up  Center for capital goods sector’; (iii) set up at least five incubation centers in  PPP mode for cross-fertilization of ideas and mentorship; and (iv) allow  
external commercial borrowings (ECB) under the automatic route.

December 31,  2016  
Demonetization: Government notified withdrawal of the legal tender of the  existing <U+20B9>500 and <U+20B9>1000 currency notes in circulation, with effect from  November 9, 2016, and be replaced with a new series of <U+20B9>500 and <U+20B9>2000  currency notes, with an objective to unearth unaccounted wealth and  eliminate counterfeit currencies from circulation. This currency exchange  process is expected to bring more economic activities into the formal sector  and spur digitization of financial transactions, helping to broaden the tax base  and boost inclusive growth.  
Roadmap for rapid adoption of digital payments: The Government  appointed a high-level panel to be chaired by Chief Minister of Andhra  Pradesh to prepare a blueprint for India’s transition to a less-cash-dependent  economy in the next 12 months. Government also constituted a Committee of  Officers led by NITI Aayog to enable 100 percent conversion of Government –  citizen transactions to the digital platform.  
Prime Minister announced measures to support informal sector affected  by demonetization: Small enterprises: Raise credit limit to 25 percent of  turnover from 20 percent; working capital loans to 30 percent of turnover  from 20 percent for enterprises that transact digitally; and enhance limits for  underwriting on loans up to Rs 20 million from Rs 10 million. Farmers: Write off interest for 60 days for loans taken from cooperative banks; issue 30  million RuPay debit cards; and give additional loans of Rs 2,000 million  though cooperative banks. Housing: Interest rate subvention on loans for  low-income housing schemes—4 percent on loans up to Rs 0.9 million; and 3  percent for loans up to Rs 1.2 million (urban areas) and for loans up to Rs 0.2  million (rural areas).  
FDI 
March 23, 2016 FDI limit for insurance and pension sectors raised from 26 percent to 49  percent under automatic route.

teleports, Direct to Home (DTH), cable networks, mobile TV under automatic  route; (iv) permitted up to 74 percent FDI under automatic route in brownfield  pharmaceuticals, and up to 100 percent under approval route; (v) permitted  100 percent FDI under automatic route in brownfield airport projects; (vi)  
raised FDI limit to 100 percent in Scheduled Air Transport Service/Domestic  Scheduled Passenger Airline and regional Air Transport Service, up to 49  
percent under automatic route and up to 100 percent through government  approval route; and (vii) FDI limit for private security agencies raised to 74  
percent, up to 49 percent under automatic route and up to 100 percent under  government approval route.  
August 31, 2016 Grant of Permanent Residency Status to Foreign Investors: Government  approved the scheme for granting of Permanent Residency Status (PRS) to  
foreign investors that would permit multiple entry for a period of 10 years,  
further extendable to a period of another 10 years. Under this arrangement  the foreign investor would be required to invest a minimum of <U+20B9>100 million  within 18 months or <U+20B9>250 million within 36 months, that should result in  
employment of at least 20 resident Indians every financial year.  
October 20, 2016 Foreign investment in Other Financial Services: Government permitted 100  percent foreign investment under the automatic route in ‘Other Financial  
Services,’ that included any financial services activities regulated by financial  sector regulators, viz., RBI, SEBI, IRDA, PFRDA, NHB or any other financial  
sector regulator notified by the government.  
Agriculture Sector 
January 27, 2016 Crop insurance scheme: The government introduced a new agricultural  insurance scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, to provide  
insurance coverage to farmers for crop failure, stabilize farmers’ income, and  encourage farmers to adopt modern agricultural practices.  
The premium payable by farmers would be (i) Kharif crops: 2 percent of sum  insured (SI); (ii) Rabi crops: 1.5 percent of SI; (iii) Commercial/horticultural  
crops: 5 percent of SI. The balance of premium to be borne equally by the  
states and center.  
April 14, 2016 National Agriculture Market (NAM): The government launched NAM, a  pan-India electronic trading portal which seeks to network the existing  
wholesale markets or produce market committees (APMCs), to create a  
unified national market for agricultural commodities. At the inauguration 21  wholesale markets in eight states were integrated for virtual trading, while the  scheme plans to integrate 585 wholesale markets by March 2018.  
May 26, 2016 Krishi Kalyan cess (KKC): Government imposed a fresh 0.5 percent KKC cess  on most services to support the agriculture sector. 
June 1, 2016 Buffer stock for pulses: Government approved a proposal to create a buffer  stock for pulses of up to 2 million tonnes, to be built through domestic  
procurement and imports of 1 million tonnes each. 
MSP for pulses: Government raised minimum support prices (MSPs) for  
pulses by 7-9 percent and offered a bonus of <U+20B9>425 per quintal for Kharif  
pulses, over and above MSP, for Arhar (Tur), Urad and Moong popular  
varieties for domestic consumption.  
June 16, 2016 Export duty on sugar: Government imposed export duty of 20 percent on  export of raw sugar, white or refined sugar, to help control domestic prices.
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 69 
INDIA 
June 22, 2016 Reforms in textile and apparel sector: Government announced several  measures to boost production and support employment generation in  
textile and apparel industry, including by: (a) permitted fixed term  
employment to address seasonal labor demand with terms and conditions  at par with permanent workers; (b) raised government’s contribution by an  additional 3.67 percent to 12 percent toward Employers Provident Fund  (EPF) Scheme for newly-recruited employees for 3 years; (c) made  
employee contributions to EPF optional for those earning less than  
Rs 15,000 per month; and (d) enlarged the coverage for duty drawback to  refund the state levies.  
Factor Market Reforms 
August 10, 2016 Maternity benefit: Government introduced Maternity Benefit (Amendment)  Bill, 2016 in Rajya Sabha (Upper house), that would increase maternity benefit  of job protection with leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks for two surviving  
children and 12 weeks for more than two children; 12 weeks for a  
'Commissioning mother' and 'Adopting mother'; facility to 'work from home';  and mandatory provision of crèche in an establishment having 50 or more  
employees. Applicable to all establishments employing 10 or more persons.  Handbook for women farmers: Government issued a ‘Farm Women Friendly  Hand Book’ containing special provisions and package of assistance which  
women farmers can claim under various on-going  
missions/submissions/schemes.  
September 9,  2016 
Railways: Indian railways introduced a new model of surge pricing for  passenger fares on an experimental basis in a few premium trains. The  dynamic pricing model, in which base fares would increase by 10% with every  10% of tickets sold, is expected to fetch more passenger revenue.  
October 2, 2016 Ratification of the Paris Climate Change Agreement: India accounts for  about 4.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and became the 62nd country to ratify the agreement, with these countries together accounting for  52 percent of global emissions. Under the agreement, India has committed to  ensuring that at least 40 percent of its electricity will be generated from non fossil-based sources by 2030. 
State Reforms  
April 8, 2016 Titling law: The state government of Rajasthan passed a law to provide  statutory backing to land records, effectively guaranteeing land and property  ownership. This will create an efficient and transparent modern land market,  provide certainty of tenure, and end litigation that often slows projects.  
Night shifts for women: The state governments of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu,  Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Sikkim have allowed women to work night 
shifts in factories by amending the laws under the Factory Act, 1948 which  
restricted women’s working hours from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Under this  
amendment, the factories will have to ensure adequate safety and security of  their women employees, both within the factory premises and during transit  from workplace to their homes.

Annex III. India: Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis  
India’s public debt remains sustainable given manageable interest rate costs and robust growth  outlook. 1 Under the baseline, assuming gradual fiscal consolidation and implementation of the  national Goods and Services Tax, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to decline gradually to  around 61 percent of GDP in the medium term from the current level of almost 70 percent, with  
gross financing needs also declining slightly to about 10 percent of GDP in 2021/22. Negative  growth shocks represent one of the major risks to the debt outlook. In addition, realization of  contingent liabilities coming from future bank recapitalization needs and further taking-on of the  liabilities of the electricity distribution companies may also push the debt trajectory up above the  70 percent benchmark, before the debt-to-GDP ratio declines gradually in the medium term. On  the other hand, the captive domestic investor base is likely to mitigate the impact of any real  interest rate shocks. India’s external debt, currently at 23½ percent of GDP, remains sustainable. 
1. India’s public debt sustainability analysis is based on the following assumptions:  
· Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth is forecast to slow to 6.6 percent (at market  prices) in 2016/17 due temporary disruptions caused by cash shortages, and then  rebound to 7.2 percent in FY2017/18, gradually rising to slightly over 8 percent in the  medium term. The upward revision to medium-term real GDP growth of about 0.4  percentage points stems from implementation of the recently passed national Goods and  Services tax,2 with CPI inflation projected to remain around 5 percent through 2021/22. In  addition, nominal GDP growth is expected to revert from an average of 9.7 percent  during 2014/15–2015/16 to an average of 12.5 percent during the next five years, in large  part due to a projected pick-up in GDP deflator.3 This baseline scenario assumes a  gradual global economic recovery scenario as outlined in the WEO.  
· Fiscal Assumptions. The 2015/16 central government fiscal deficit came in at 3.9 percent  of GDP (in line with the authorities’ deficit target of 3.9 percent of GDP), which  corresponds to 4.1 percent under the Fund’s definition. Over the medium term, the  central government’s fiscal deficit (as per IMF definition) is expected to decline slowly  toward 3.0 percent of GDP, while state government deficits should decline to about  2.5 percent of GDP. Staff projections (which are based on current policies and assume no  additional major legislative changes) imply that the central government will  underperform against its fiscal adjustment targets.  
1 The analysis of public debt sustainability is based on the framework developed for market access countries. See  Staff Guidance Note for Public Debt Sustainability Analysis in Market Access Countries, IMF, May 2013.  
2 Growth-enhancing channels of GST are multiple, such as reducing cascading of taxes and creating a single  national market, enhancing the efficiency of intra-Indian movement of goods and service, and boosting  competitiveness of the Indian exports. The growth impact assumption is on the lower end of medium-term  growth boost experienced in other countries.

72 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 
o Tax performance, especially for income taxes, is expected to increase slightly as  ongoing administrative measures continue to be implemented and base broadening  is expected to continue. Introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is assumed  to entail a revenue neutral rate.  
o At the same time, while savings from reduced fuel subsidies have already been  realized as diesel prices have been deregulated, the planned gradual introduction of  cash transfers should help rationalize spending over the medium term. However, the  Food Security Act and fertilizer subsidies will keep the subsidy bill high.  
o Public banks are expected to be recapitalized to reach Basel III targets (baseline  assumes ¼ of one percent of FY2018/19 GDP cumulative over the next three years).  Recent announcements indicate state governments have taken on a large portion of  the debt of electricity distribution companies (around 1.1 percent of GDP) since the  roll-out of the UDAY scheme in November 2015, which is the key reason behind an  upward revision to 2015/16 and 2016/17 debt ratios compared to the 2016 Article IV  Staff Report. The contingent liabilities shock scenario incorporates state governments  assuming an additional 1 percent of GDP of power distribution companies’ debt,  which corresponds to the maximum remaining eligible amount, and 3 percent for  banking sector recapitalization.  
2. Under the baseline projection, India’s debt ratio and gross financing needs will stay  on a declining path from 2017/18. India’s primary deficit is projected to trend downward and  remain below its debt-stabilizing threshold (estimated at 3.1 percent of GDP based on the  2021/22 projections) in the projection years. Therefore, gross financing needs are expected to  remain at slightly below 12 percent of GDP in 2016/17 before gradually declining to about  10 percent in 2021/22. Automatic debt dynamics arising from the interest rate-growth  differential will on average reduce the debt ratio by close to 2<U+2154> percentage points per year from  2016/17 to 2021/22, in part due to low real interest rates on public debt as a result of financial  repression (through the SLR). As a result, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to fall from  about 69.8 percent in 2015/16 to 60.9 percent in 2021/22. The 2020/21 public debt-to-GDP ratio  is about 1½ percentage points higher than the last Staff Report, reflecting an upward data  revision of the historical public debt path and state government taking on of electricity  distribution companies’ debt. Notably, higher projected nominal GDP growth, as a result of the  growth-enhancing effects of GST, underpins the growth driver of favorable debt dynamics.  
3. India faces relatively low risks to debt sustainability under the baseline, but could  be vulnerable to slower real GDP growth and a contingent liability shock. The heat map  suggests that the debt burden benchmark and the gross financing needs threshold are exceeded  under a contingent liability shock. A contingent liability shock (which could arise from losses at 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 73 
INDIA 
public banks and debt restructuring of electricity distribution companies)4 pushes the debt-to GDP ratio to around 75 percent in 2017/18 and 2018/19. A one-standard deviation shock to real  GDP growth increases the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 72¼ percent in 2018/19. Both shocks,  however, do not change the downward debt trajectory in the medium term. Lack of fiscal  adjustment is another principal risk to debt sustainability in India’s context. An unchanged  primary balance would slow the debt reduction in the near term. Finally, the combined macro fiscal shock also has a large level effect but does not change the direction of the debt trajectory.  As a result, the asymmetric fan chart suggests that upside risks to debt ratio dominate in the  medium term. Overall, risks are mitigated by the fact that most of the public debt is financed  through a captive domestic investor base, the very small external debt is mostly from official  creditors, and adequate international reserves are available in the rare case that external  financing needs arise. Risks that could improve India’s public debt sustainability include better  tax buoyancy, a better-than expected GST impact on growth, and a new Direct Tax Code  (including improvements in tax administration) that improve efficiency and lead to near-term  revenue gains. A stronger revival of the economy could also return India to the debt dynamics  prevailing before the global financial crisis.  
4. There is no evidence of a systematic projection bias in the baseline assumptions  and the projected fiscal adjustment is in line with other countries’ experiences. India’s  forecast track record exceeds that of most surveillance countries, with percentile ranks in excess  of 90 (for real GDP growth) and 77 (for primary balance). India’s projected fiscal adjustment (an  improvement of around three-quarters of one percentage point in cyclically-adjusted primary  balance/GDP over the medium term) is modest and should be achievable. This magnitude of  adjustment is also in line with other countries’ experiences, with a three-year adjustment in  cyclically-adjusted primary balance at the 44th percentile among all surveillance countries with  market access. The boom-bust analysis is not triggered because India had a negative output gap  in 2015/16.  
4 The contingent liabilities shock is customized to reflect: (i) the central government bearing the full cost of PSBs’  recapitalization in a severe stress scenario (about 3 percent of GDP), and (ii) state governments assuming 75  percent of the remaining debt of the electricity distribution companies that may become eligible for restructuring  (about 1 percent of GDP).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with India  
On February 12, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded  the Article IV consultation1 with India.  
The Indian economy is on a recovery path, helped by a large terms of trade gain (about  2.5 percent of GDP), positive policy actions, and reduced external vulnerabilities. Since late  2014, a collapse of global oil prices has boosted economic activity in India and underpinned a  further improvement in the current account and fiscal positions, and engendered a sharp decline  in inflation. A range of supply-side measures (including release of surplus grain buffer stocks)  and an appropriate monetary stance have also contributed to the decline in inflation, from an  average of about 9.5 percent during 2011–13 to 5.6 percent in December 2015. Due to its  further-reduced vulnerabilities and improved growth prospects, India has experienced large  foreign direct investment inflows in 2015. As a result, and in conjunction with the continued  much-smaller current account deficit (largely due to continued low global commodity prices),  international reserves have increased by $46.7 billion since end-March 2014, standing at  US$350.4 billion at end-December 2015 (around 8 months of import cover). Nonetheless,  persistently high household inflation expectations and large fiscal deficits remain key  macroeconomic challenges, resulting in limited policy space to support growth through demand  management measures. Furthermore, anemic exports as well as headwinds from weaknesses in  India’s corporate financial positions and public bank balance sheets weigh on the economy.  
Growth is projected at 7.3 percent for fiscal year FY2015/16, picking up to 7.5 percent in  FY2016/17 (at market prices), supported by stronger domestic demand. With the revival of  sentiment and picking up of industrial activity, an incipient upturn in private investment is  expected to help broaden the recovery. Higher public infrastructure investment and government  initiatives to tackle supply-side bottlenecks and repair corporate and public bank balance sheets

should also help crowd-in private investment. The Reserve Bank has achieved its inflation target  to bring inflation below 6 percent by January 2016. Going forward, near-term headline consumer  price inflation dynamics will continue to be underpinned by supply-side factors which, despite  the subpar crop outlook, should help achieve the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation goal of  around 5 percent for March 2017. Notwithstanding the 125 basis points nominal policy rate cut  in 2015, monetary conditions remain consistent with achieving the inflation target of 5 percent  by March 2017. Despite the recent export slowdown, continued low global oil prices should  help contain the current account deficit at around 1.5 percent of GDP in FY2016/17. The  FY2015/16 Union budget deficit target of 3.9 percent of GDP (equivalent to about 4.25 percent  of GDP in IMF terms) will likely be achieved.  
While the balance of risks has improved, economic risks remain tilted to the downside. On the  external side, despite the reduction in imbalances and strengthening of buffers, the impact from  intensified global financial market volatility could be disruptive, including from unexpected  developments in the course of U.S. monetary policy normalization or China’s growth slowdown.  Absent disruptive global financial market volatility, slower growth in China would have only  modest adverse spillovers to India, given weak trade linkages. Domestic risks include continued  weaknesses in corporate financial positions and public bank asset quality, as well as setbacks in  the reform process, which could weigh on growth, accelerate inflation and undermine sentiment.  On the upside, further structural reforms could lead to stronger growth, as would a sustained  period of low global energy prices.  
Executive Board Assessment2 
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their appropriate policy actions that—along  with favorable terms of trade—have underpinned India’s improved economic performance and  reduced external vulnerabilities. They welcomed in particular recent measures aimed at  increasing public infrastructure spending, rationalizing subsidies, creating more flexible labor  and product markets, and enhancing financial inclusion. Looking forward, Directors noted that  global financial market volatility, a potential further deterioration in exports, and strains in bank  and corporate balance sheets could weigh on India’s growth prospects. Meanwhile, high fiscal  deficits and upside risks to inflation constrain the scope for countercyclical policies.  
Against this backdrop, Directors underscored the need for continued vigilance, growth-friendly  fiscal consolidation, and sustained reforms to enhance the resilience of the economy and bolster  potential growth. Addressing supply constraints and further improving the business environment  remain important priorities. Progress in these areas would have a positive impact on poverty  reduction.  
2 At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of  Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers  used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors stressed the importance of preserving external stability. They noted that  India’s international reserves are assessed to be adequate. Directors agreed that, in the event of a  surge in global financial market volatility, exchange rate flexibility remains a key shock absorber,  complemented by judicious foreign exchange intervention. They encouraged the authorities to  sustain the reform momentum to further enhance investor confidence and attract foreign direct  investment, while cautiously liberalizing external commercial borrowings by the private sector.  
Directors welcomed the adoption of flexible inflation targeting and progress in enhancing  monetary policy transmission. Given upside risks to inflation and still high household inflation  expectations, Directors agreed that the monetary policy stance should remain appropriately  targeted at ensuring durable reduction in inflation toward the medium-term target, supported by  clear policy communication, continued fiscal consolidation, and measures to boost food supply.  They encouraged the monetary authorities to stand ready to tighten the stance if warranted.  
Directors welcomed the recent improvements in the quality and efficiency of public expenditure,  as well as revenue-enhancing measures. They called on the authorities to articulate and  implement credible measures that would underpin the achievement of the medium-term fiscal  deficit targets and increase fiscal space for priority capital spending and social expenditures.  Crucial in this regard are further reforms of fertilizer and food subsidies, a well-designed goods  and services tax, and improved tax administration.  
Directors saw as priorities for the authorities to accelerate reforms to remove supply-side  bottlenecks, especially in the agricultural and power sectors; and to facilitate land acquisition.  Further reforms are also essential to boost employment in the formal sector, encourage female  labor force participation, and enhance labor market flexibility more broadly.  
While acknowledging that India’s financial system is generally sound, Directors noted potential  risks from weak corporate and bank balance sheets. They supported ongoing efforts to further  enhance bank supervision, and encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen prudential  regulation for bank asset quality recognition, augment capital buffers and improve corporate  governance at public sector banks, as well as enhance the bankruptcy and insolvency framework.  A further deepening of capital markets would also facilitate financial intermediation.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION  KEY ISSUES  
Outlook and Risks: The Indian economy is on a recovery path, helped by a large terms of  trade gain, positive policy actions, improved confidence, and reduced external vulnerabilities.  A faster-than-expected decline in inflation created space for nominal policy rate cuts.  Persistently high inflation expectations and large fiscal deficits remain key macroeconomic  challenges, resulting in limited policy space to support growth through demand  management measures. In addition, supply bottlenecks and structural challenges constrain  medium-term growth and hinder job creation. Risks are weighted to the downside, with  external risks mainly from intensified global financial market volatility and slower global  growth. On the domestic side, a further weakening of bank and corporate balance sheets  could pose risks to economic recovery and weigh on financial stability, while setbacks in the  pace of structural reforms could dampen growth and undermine sentiment. In contrast,  lower-for-longer global energy prices constitute an upside risk for India. 
Key Policy Recommendations:  
· To achieve the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) “glide path” towards its medium-term inflation target of 4 percent, the monetary stance should remain tight to ensure a durable reduction in inflation and still-high household inflation expectations, supported by measures to boost food supply and continued fiscal consolidation. 
· The Union budget deficit target of 3.9 percent of GDP for FY2015/16 will likely be achieved. Looking ahead, while accommodating an appropriate increase in public capital spending, medium-term fiscal consolidation should continue, underpinned by revenue-raising reforms (including by introducing the GST and improvements in revenue administration) and further reductions in subsidies. 
· To safeguard financial stability in the presence of elevated corporate and banking sector strains, NPAs on public banks’ balance sheets should be fully recognized; banking sector structural reforms continued; banks’ loss-absorbing buffers increased; monitoring of corporate vulnerabilities strengthened; and banks’ debt recovery mechanisms further enhanced. 
· Several important economic and structural reforms have been initiated. Additional steps in relaxing long-standing supply bottlenecks, especially in the mining and power sectors, as well as further labor market reforms, are crucial to achieving faster and more inclusive growth.

CONTEXT  
1. The Indian economy is on a recovery path, supported by a large terms of trade gain  (about 2½ percent of GDP) and reduced external vulnerabilities, though downside risks remain.  After bottoming at 5.1 percent in FY2012/13, the economy has been on a gradual cyclical recovery,  reaching 7.3 percent growth in FY2014/15 with a revival of sentiment. 1 2 Since late 2014, a halving of  global oil prices has boosted economic activity in India and underpinned a further improvement in its  current account and fiscal positions, and engendered a sharp decline in inflation (Boxes 1 and 2).3 As a  result of further-reduced external vulnerabilities, improved growth prospects, and continued monetary  accommodation in advanced economies, India has experienced large FDI and portfolio capital inflows, a  real appreciation of the rupee, and a robust rebound in foreign exchange reserves in FY2014/15.  Nonetheless, despite better growth prospects, India faces the risk of capital flow reversals and should  guard against the buildup of domestic vulnerabilities.

2. Important economic and structural reforms have been initiated, but further reforms are  needed to boost India’s growth potential. Following its election victory in May 2014, the Bharatiya  Janata Party (BJP)-led government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has gradually introduced  numerous economic reforms (see Annex I and Box 3), including subsidy reforms, steps to create more  flexible labor and product markets, agricultural reforms (including the new crop insurance scheme), enhancing financial inclusion, relaxing FDI limits in several key sectors and improving the ease of doing  business, raising Foreign Portfolio Investment limits in public debt securities, and increasing public  infrastructure spending. Flexible inflation targeting was also adopted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)  in February 2015. Nonetheless, in the last two sessions of Parliament the passage of key legislation,  including the long-planned goods and services tax, was not secured given the lack of BJP control of the  upper house of Parliament.  
1 In January 2015, India’s Ministry of Statistics released the new series of national accounts. Upward revisions of the  GDP growth rate for 2012/13 and 2013/14 in part reflected methodological changes. Lack of back-casted historical  GDP data based on the new methodology constrains a comparison of current growth with past growth.  2 The output gap is currently estimated at about -0.5 percent.  
3As the global commodity price boom unwinds, India’s terms of trade has improved significantly (jumping by  4 percent in 2014/15 and a further 7 percent in 2015/16), supporting output growth and raising real incomes.  
4 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 
3. Notwithstanding the cyclical pickup, medium-term growth continues to be  constrained by supply-side bottlenecks and weaknesses in the corporate and banking  sectors. Past weak economic growth and delays in implementing infrastructure projects have  placed pressure on banks’ asset quality (particularly at state-owned banks that lent heavily to  infrastructure companies). Corporate vulnerability indicators remain elevated. Long-standing  supply-side bottlenecks, especially in the energy, mining and power sectors, continue to weigh on  India’s growth potential.  
4. Past Fund advice and the authorities’ macroeconomic policies have been broadly  aligned, but progress on structural reforms has been partial. There has been substantial fiscal  consolidation in recent years (although it has paused in FY2015/16), and staff supports the  improvement in quality of fiscal adjustment this year with its welcome emphasis on public investment. Excise duties on petrol and diesel have been raised, important kerosene and LPG subsidy  allocation and distribution reforms have been pursued, and some progress has been made on  reducing and rationalizing fertilizer subsidies, broadly in line with previous IMF advice. The stance  of monetary policy was appropriately tight in 2014/15 to reduce inflation along the RBI’s “glide path”,  consistent with Fund advice. The RBI has adopted a flexible inflation targeting regime, with headline CPI  inflation the principal nominal anchor for monetary policy. Progress on land and labor market reforms  has been limited, though some market reforms have been initiated by the center and a few states.  
OUTLOOK AND RISKS  
5. India’s growth outlook has improved, despite new headwinds. In the near term,  economic recovery is expected to continue to be underpinned by private consumption (which has  
benefited from lower energy prices and higher  real wages). Policy credibility has also

by recovery in domestic demand. Nonetheless, anemic exports as well as headwinds from  weaknesses in India’s corporate financial positions and public bank balance sheets will weigh on  the economy. In the presence of continued supply-side bottlenecks, and assuming no substantial  legislative initiatives, medium-term growth is projected to remain at around 7¾ percent. 
6. Despite a sharp reduction in inflation over the past year, medium-term inflationary  pressures and upside risks to inflation remain. Headline CPI inflation declined to 5.6 percent in  December 2015, down from an average of 10 percent during 2009-13, reflecting economic slack,  the RBI’s tight monetary policy stance, lower global commodity prices and government efforts to  
contain food inflation (through release of surplus grain buffer stocks and low minimum support  price increases in agriculture) (see Box 5). Although the 6 percent inflation target for January 2016  is expected to be met, upside risks to inflation for FY2016/17 stem from an unfavorable monsoon  and implementation of the pay review of government employees.6 7 Given food supply constraints  and the ingrained nature of household inflation expectations (which remain near double-digits),  inflation is expected to remain close to the upper limit of the RBI’s medium-term inflation target  band (4 percent CPI inflation ± 2 percent).  
7. The current account deficit (CAD) has narrowed further, helped by sharply lower  commodity import prices. From a high of 4.8 percent of GDP in FY2012/13, the CAD has  compressed sharply to an average of 1.5 percent of GDP in the past two years. This narrowing was  helped by a policy-induced fall in the volume of gold imports and, more recently, by lower  commodity prices (see Box 6).8 Notwithstanding the recent export slowdown, continued low  global oil prices should help contain the CAD.9 The CAD is expected to widen to 2½ percent of  
GDP over the medium term as domestic demand  
strengthens further and commodity prices  20 
gradually rebound. However, the sluggish global

profitable, and have low NPAs and limited exposure to troubled sectors, low profitability and  further asset quality deterioration in public sector banks (PSBs) constrain the banking system’s  capacity to expand credit. In addition, a thin investment pipeline, reflecting still low capacity  utilization in core sectors and areas of high corporate leverage (and recourse of higher-quality  borrowers to capital markets), have reduced the demand for bank credit. Further deterioration in  asset quality could lower capital levels and thereby weigh on credit supply and the investment  recovery. In addition, although capital markets have partly substituted for bank credit, their ability  to provide adequate, stable financing for the growth recovery will hinge on investor sentiment,  and on further policy measures to deepen capital market liquidity.10  
9. While the balance of risks has clearly improved, economic risks remain tilted to the  downside. On the external side, despite the reduction in imbalances and strengthening of buffers,  the impact from intensified global financial market volatility could be disruptive, including from  unexpected developments in the course of U.S. monetary policy normalization or China’s growth  slowdown, particularly against the backdrop of recent large capital inflows.11 Absent disruptive  global financial market volatility, slower growth in China would have only modest adverse  spillovers to India, given weak trade linkages (see Box 8). Domestic risks include continued  weaknesses in corporate financial positions and public bank asset quality, as well as setbacks in  the reform process, which could weigh on growth, accelerate inflation and undermine sentiment.  On the upside, further structural reforms could lead to stronger growth, as would a sustained  period of low global energy prices (see Annex II: Risk Assessment Matrix).  
Authorities’ Views  
10. The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s view on the outlook. They agreed that  the Indian economy is in the early stage of recovery with some areas of weakness, and—in view of  the recovering investment pipeline—project real growth for the current fiscal year at about  7½ percent, rising slightly in FY2016/17. They acknowledged that some indicators, such as the  growth of indirect tax receipts, are consistent with economic growth in the 7½ percent range, but  they also noted that other high-frequency data, including corporate profitability and capacity  utilization, do not corroborate this rate. The RBI estimates the output gap at about -½ of one  percent.  
11. Nevertheless, the authorities feel they are well prepared to weather any surge in  global financial market volatility. The RBI has adequate reserves, including after adjustment for  forward contracts, and there remains scope for monetary policy action. There was agreement with  staff that exchange rate flexibility has served India well, and the authorities noted that corporate  hedging ratios have risen over the past year. Finally, a part of the oil price decline windfall was

11 During early January 2016 episode of China-induced global financial market volatility, India largely resisted the  spillover pressures. Stock markets only declined by about 3 percent, the rupee depreciated by about 1 percent  against the U.S. dollar, and FII outflows were limited (about $100 million). See also Selected Issues Chapter IV for  an analysis of the summer 2015 episode of global financial market volatility.

saved by the government in the form of higher petroleum product excise taxes, and this  represents a potential buffer against a spike in global commodity prices.  
KEY POLICY ISSUES  
A. Bolstering Robustness of the Financial Sector  
12. Elevated corporate sector risks and weakened bank balance sheets, especially for  PSBs, pose headwinds for economic growth. With the corporate sector (non-household  lending) accounting for over 80 percent of banks’ credit portfolios, banking sector soundness and  its ability to finance investment and growth rest on the financial health of the domestic corporate  sector.12 Corporate vulnerabilities remain elevated, reflecting implementation delays and cost  overruns in infrastructure projects, and challenges to effective debt restructuring. The share of  debt held by firms with weak debt repayment capacity (interest coverage ratio below one)  remains close to a decade-long high, at about 11 percent as of end-March 2015 (see Selected  Issues Chapter I). Corporate leverage—particularly among large firms and in a few key sectors—is  one of the highest across EMs, reflecting increased reliance on bank funding to meet high capital  investment requirements in the late 2000s. Industries subject to greater stress, particularly those  
with weakened debt servicing capacity— including infrastructure, textiles, iron and  
180

steel, and mining—account for nearly one  140 
third of banks’ total loans and more than half

13. Public sector banks continue to face asset quality difficulties, contributing to a  slowdown in credit expansion. The share of PSBs’ stressed assets—including gross non performing assets (NPAs) and restructured assets—in total advances continued to increase to  14.1 percent at end-September 2015 (of which NPAs stand at 6.2 percent), from 12.9 percent a  year earlier.14 Weaker credit quality, due in part to poor governance and lack of commercial  incentives, has kept PSBs’ profitability depressed, with ROA of around 0.4 percent in the past two  fiscal years, below the 0.8 percent average in the preceding three years, and well below the 1.7  
12 India’s stocks of household debt (10 percent of GDP) and corporate debt (50 percent of GDP) are relatively small  compared to other major emerging market economies.  
13 Indian corporates’ FX funding has continued to account for up to a fifth of total funding, as of end-March 2015.  RBI data show that the hedge ratio for external commercial borrowings (ECB) and foreign currency convertible  bonds (excluding natural hedges) increased to about 39 percent in FY2014/15 and about 41 percent in the first  quarter of FY2015/16, from about 15 percent of borrowings in FY2013/14. However, a sharp increase in hedging  costs could adversely affect corporates’ hedging ability.  
14 Based on data from RBI’s Financial Stability Report, December 2015 (Issue No.12). Past countercyclical measures  were not fully effective in averting a deterioration in banks’ asset quality (see Selected Issues Chapter II).

percent ROA of private sector banks. While provisioning for stressed assets has increased  gradually over time, there are still concerns about possible underprovisioning, with average NPA  provisioning of about 40 percent. In addition, the need for capital preservation, given eroding  asset quality, has accounted for a marked slowdown in credit growth at PSBs to 6.1 percent year on-year as of end-June 2015 (alternatively 7.4 percent as of end-FY2014/15), down from 14.0  percent at end-FY2013/14. While PSBs’ credit growth is expected to remain muted, its impact on  growth is lessened by the relatively low credit intensity of the Indian economy and the pick-up in  nonbank financing.15

14. PSBs’ capital augmentation needs are expected to be manageable, but may require  further fiscal outlays. Under a stress scenario assuming a transition of 15 percent of restructured  loans to NPAs and an extra capital cushion of 2 percentage points, PSBs’ capital needs are  estimated to account for 2.9 percent of FY2018/19 GDP (cumulatively over the next four years),  with a government share of 1.9 percent of FY2018/19 GDP (see Box 9, Annex III, and Selected  Issues Chapter I).16 
15. Full recognition of risks on PSBs’ balance sheets, adequate capitalization, and  further governance reforms are critical for strengthening the banking sector going forward.  In this regard, staff recommends the following policy measures:  
· Phasing out remaining forbearance. New regulations (as of April 1, 2015) curb considerably  banks’ ability to resort to forbearance by requiring banks to classify new restructured loans as  NPAs, and hence provision appropriately. However, there are still certain exemptions,  
15 Non-bank funding has seen a considerable uptick, with the stock of outstanding commercial paper (CP) up by  about 80 percent in FY2014/15 (reflecting lower funding costs), and lending by non-bank financial corporations  (NBFCs) up by 20 percent over the same period.  
16 This estimate includes a cumulative capital injection of 0.8 percent of FY2018/19 GDP over four years, related to  the ongoing implementation of Basel III in India, expected to be finalized by March 2019. The estimate for the  government’s share assumes no dilution of government ownership in PSBs, currently at about 61 percent.  Implementation of the Basel III capital framework is progressing and is expected to be completed by end-March  2019. All banks currently meet the minimum 8 percent Tier-1 capital requirement under Basel III and its Indian  equivalent of 9 percent. However, further Basel III capital requirements and potential risk weight changes would  necessitate additional capital infusions (see Selected Issues Chapter I).  
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9 
INDIA 
including on postponing reclassifications of restructured loans on projects with delayed  implementation schedules (projects deemed to be viable but with temporary problems), and  on extending amortization schedules of classes of loans (provided there is no change in  present value terms). 
· Bank recapitalization. To support PSBs' current lending capacity, the authorities should  consider larger government capital injections in PSBs and some divestments of banks’ non core assets. The government’s capital injections in PSBs per the Indradhanush plan (August 2015)  are quite modest in scale (0.3 percent of FY2018/19 GDP cumulatively over the next four years),  and largely leave recapitalizations up to the ability of affected PSBs to raise capital in the markets.  
· Corporate debt restructuring. To boost corporate loan recovery, banks are now allowed (under  the Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR) scheme) to convert corporate loans into equity if  debtors cannot meet debt restructuring plans. Debt-to-equity conversions are only a partial  solution, given high corporate leverage ratios and hence limits on debt recovery. The  authorities should continue to place priority on improving corporate debt restructuring  mechanisms, including the formal insolvency framework (passage of the new Insolvency and  Bankruptcy Bill and the Company Law Tribunals) and out-of-court debt restructuring  (introduction of robust mechanisms for both operational and financial restructuring). These  initiatives would build upon the LEG-provided capacity building assistance in these areas.  
· PSB governance reforms. The authorities should follow through on the Indradhanush plan’s  commitment to structural reforms, including on enhancing PSBs’ corporate governance, risk  management practices and accountability. 
16. The Indian government remains fully committed to enhancing financial inclusion. Its  financial inclusion agenda has broadened over the past year (see Box 10). The government’s proposed  introduction of gold monetization schemes is also, in part, meant to boost financial intermediation by  channeling domestic gold holdings to gold savings accounts (see Selected Issues Chapter III). Continued emphasis on increasing transactional volumes on Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts by expanding the range of provided financial services (including Aadhaar supported17 direct benefit transfers), and linking these to new technologies (e.g., via use of mobile  solutions), and potentially provided by the newly-formed payments banks, would support financial  inclusion.  
17. Additional measures would help maintain financial stability and enhance the  contribution of the financial sector to growth. Staff supports the following measures:  
· Facilitating further deepening of the domestic corporate bond market, including, among  others, by developing robust bondholder protection mechanisms, improving liquidity in the  secondary market, and rationalizing stamp duties on bond issuances. Easing investment  restrictions on domestic institutional investor classes would be important to support the  development of a broader investor base.  
17 India’s Unique Identification Authority began to issue biometric identification numbers to residents in  September 2010. Identities are authenticated based on the holder’s fingerprints or iris scan. As of January 2016,  the program had enrolled over 966 million people (https://portal.uidai.gov.in/uidwebportal/dashboard.do). 
10 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 
· Enacting a further gradual reduction of banks’ statutory liquidity requirement (SLR), as the  government’s fiscal deficit declines, to facilitate more private sector lending. The Indian  government has been gradually reducing the SLR rate (currently at 21.5 percent, down from  25 percent of deposit liabilities in mid-2008), and plans to reduce the ratio to 20.5 percent by  January 2017. 18  
Authorities’ Views  
18. The authorities recognized the challenges of addressing corporate balance sheet  stress. They emphasized their efforts to strike a balance between creating room on bank balance  sheets and instilling payment discipline. Several schemes have been introduced to promote debt  restructuring, including the recent Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) power sector scheme19 for electricity distribution companies (November 2015), while forbearance has been phased out,  with any debt restructured under the Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) window now requiring  provisioning at the same level as NPAs. The emphasis on labeling loan nonpayers as “willful  defaulters” has had some effect, and mergers and acquisitions activity is beginning to pick up.  Finally, they were very optimistic that the new Bankruptcy Bill (introduced in parliament in  December 2015) will close a loophole in the corporate finance architecture, and took note of staff  views that the formal bankruptcy set-up needs to be complemented by an appropriate out-of court settlement framework.  
19. There was, however, a general view that the cause of anemic credit growth is mainly  inadequate demand. To some extent the commercial paper market and non-bank financial  intermediaries have taken up some of the slack, but anemic investment and the slow recovery of  private sector borrowing suggest that the investment cycle has yet to definitively turn. The  authorities also agreed with staff’s view that the fiscal cost of recapitalizing PSBs will be modest.  They noted that strong steps are being taken to improve corporate governance in PSBs, which  should help to reduce the flow of new bad assets going forward. Finally, the authorities are  looking forward to the upcoming 2016/17 FSAP for inputs on how to continue building a financial  system that is efficient and inclusive. They also urged staff to carefully review the upcoming  Financial Stability Board (FSB) Peer Review of India (due by September 2016), to avoid duplication  of effort in the FSAP.  
20. The authorities also noted that, in the presence of elevated corporate and banking  sector strains, they have taken extensive measures to safeguard financial stability. These  include: the withdrawal of forbearance by requiring banks to classify and provision restructured    
18 Under India’s system of parallel bank liquidity requirements—including India’s own SLR and the Basel III liquidity  coverage ratio (LCR)—banks face conservative liquidity requirements. Further reductions of the SLR are, thus,  important in order to lessen the burden on domestic banks.  
19 Under UDAY, state electricity distribution companies will enter a tripartite agreement with the Ministry of Power  and relevant State Governments, and 75 percent of their outstanding debt (as of September 2015) will be taken up  by states in a staggered manner over the next two years. The scheme aims to enforce financial discipline, improve  operational efficiency, and reduce power and interest costs. 
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11 
INDIA 
loans as NPAs; monitoring closely likely NPAs via the Central Repository of Information on Large  Credits (CRILC); and encouraging corporate debt restructuring and strategic debt restructuring.  They underscored that extensions of loan amortization schedules under current regulations should  not be construed as forbearance, given that these pertain to the refinancing of projects (in  infrastructure and core industries) that do face any credit weakness. Overall, the authorities  emphasized that the recent policy measures seek to induce a structural change in project financing,  including a shift to long-term structured financing and a change in banks’ mindset to ensure that  project financing is carried out per international best practices.  
B. Complement the New Monetary Policy Framework with Structural  Policies to Durably Reduce Inflation  
21. The collapse in global commodity  prices, a range of supply-side measures, and  a relatively tight monetary stance have

achieve the RBI’s 6 percent inflation target for early 2016. Notwithstanding the 125 basis points  nominal policy rate cut in 2015, monetary conditions remain consistent with achieving the  inflation target of 5 percent by March 2017.20 However, in light of upside risks to inflation, the  authorities should stand ready to raise the policy rate if inflationary pressures gather pace.  
22. Adoption of a flexible inflation targeting  regime by the RBI provides a robust institutional  foundation for maintaining price stability in an  increasingly complex economy. With the formal  adoption of flexible inflation targeting in February  2015, the presence of a well-defined nominal anchor  and a clear policy objective has strengthened policy

transmission21 and structural liquidity management. Nonetheless, bringing down inflation  expectations of the general public and anchoring them at a lower level has proven challenging, as  food inflation propagates rapidly into non-food inflation, and household inflation expectations  remain near double digits.22 Breaking away from the adaptive nature of Indian inflation  expectations will likely require a prolonged period of low inflation, underpinned by a continued  anti-inflationary monetary policy stance.23  
23. Introducing durable supply side measures, continued fiscal consolidation, relieving  impediments to monetary transmission, and finalizing a robust Monetary Policy Committee  (MPC) are prerequisites for low inflation in the medium term. Staff views the medium-term 4  percent inflation target adopted by the RBI as broadly appropriate. However, in view of India’s  large weight on food in its CPI basket and structurally-high food inflation, achieving this target on  a sustained basis will require ramping up food supply commensurate with strong consumption  demand. Further structural reforms to increase food production are needed, particularly to  accommodate dietary shifts towards more nutritious and protein-based foods associated with  growing incomes.24 Staff sees scope for improving food grain buffer stock management, and for  increasing investment in storage and distribution infrastructure for perishable produce. A strong  institutional design of the RBI’s MPC, supporting credible monetary policy making, remains  paramount for the success of the new monetary framework, as does further reducing  impediments to monetary transmission (including administered interest rates on small savings  schemes) and continued fiscal consolidation.25 
Authorities’ Views  
24. The authorities acknowledged that achieving their medium-term inflation target of  4 percent would be a challenge in the absence of structural reforms, particularly in  agriculture. They agreed with staff that the January 2016 target will be met, and were optimistic  that inflation will fall to 5 percent by early 2017. In addition the authorities viewed household  inflation expectations as on a declining trend. In their view, by reducing the policy rate by 125  basis points in 2015 they had implemented an accommodative monetary stance, but emphasized  that these rate cuts had been front loaded and further cuts would be contingent on inflation  developments and ongoing fiscal consolidation. The authorities also recognized that the recent  
21 In order to improve the efficiency of monetary policy transmission, new RBI guidelines will require banks to  move to marginal-cost-of-funds-based determination of their lending rates from April 1, 2016. Prior to this, banks  were following different methodologies in computing their lending rates, including those based on average costs  of funds.  
22 See R. Anand, D. Ding and V. Tulin (2014), “Food Inflation in India: Role for Monetary Policy,” IMF WP 14/148.  23 Low and stable inflation is the best way for monetary policy to support Indian growth over the medium term.  Staff analysis concludes that CPI inflation exceeding 5½ percent is particularly detrimental to long-term economic  growth—see K. Mohaddes and M. Raissi (2014), “Does Inflation Slow Long-run Growth in India?”, IMF WP 14/222.  24 See R. Anand, N. Kumar and V. Tulin (2016), “Understanding India’s Food Inflation: The Role of Demand and  Supply Factors,” IMF WP 16/2.  
25 On asymmetric monetary transmission, see S. Das (2015), “Monetary Policy in India: Transmission to Bank  Interest Rates,” IMF WP 15/129. Transmission would benefit from reducing the SLR over time to a level in line with  the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), continued focus on increasing competition in the banking sector, and progress  on financial inclusion which will decrease the presence of informal finance.

windfall of lower world oil prices will not be repeated. They pointed out that some portion of food  inflation during the past year stemmed from the subpar monsoon, and that it would be unlikely  for three monsoons in a row to be so poor. They pointed out that a range of supply side reforms  are being undertaken in the agricultural sector that should raise productivity and facilitate price  stability.  
C. Consolidating the Fiscal Position  
25. Although near-term fiscal consolidation has paused, the spending mix has  improved. While FY2014/15 Union Budget execution outperformed the target, this was largely  achieved as a result of cuts in capital spending to make up for overly optimistic revenue  assumptions in the budget. The FY2015/16 Budget targets a fiscal deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP  (equivalent to about 4¼ percent of GDP in IMF terms), and will likely be achieved. This deficit is  0.3 percentage points of GDP higher than envisaged in the previous roadmap for fiscal  consolidation. While staff would have preferred a deficit path in line with the roadmap, the  FY2015/16 Budget contains a welcome emphasis on public investment (0.25 percent of GDP  increase over FY2014/15) and a further reduction in fuel subsidies (see Annex V: Subsidy Reform  Progress). Nonetheless, given a possible shortfall in disinvestment proceeds, expenditure may  again come under pressure. As the expenditure side gains from declining global oil prices have  been largely exhausted, the authorities should take the opportunity to continue to raise  petroleum-related revenues. Staff recommends that any increased expenditure arising from the  Seventh Pay Commission be phased over time.  
26. Medium-term fiscal targets have been delayed and appear to be challenging. The  achievement of the medium-term Union deficit target of 3 percent of GDP has been deferred to  FY2017/18, one year later than previously planned. 26 India’s overall fiscal position remains  vulnerable, given that at the general government level the deficit is expected to remain around 6- 7 percent of GDP, which is high by global standards, and could pose challenges to durably  reducing inflation. Moreover, with the increase in net transfers to states and no offsetting  consolidation expected from the states, measures at the center need to be further articulated.  Given the absence of clear medium-term fiscal plans, staff’s projections (which are on the basis of  current policies and assume no major legislative changes) suggest that the central government  will underperform against its fiscal adjustment targets. Also, the lack of a binding medium-term  fiscal framework raises questions about the credibility of medium-term consolidation plans.  Nonetheless, India’s public debt (with a favorable maturity structure and currency composition, as  well as a captive domestic investor base) remains on a downward path and is sustainable (see  Annex III: Debt Sustainability Analysis). As in the 2015 Article IV consultation, staff recommends  that when fiscal space is rebuilt, future fiscal responsibility legislation should be underpinned by a  
26 To institutionalize financial discipline in public finances, the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act  (2003) introduced a medium-term ceiling for the central government’s fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP. India’s  public-debt-to-GDP ratio has been reduced from 83 percent in 2005 to 65 percent as at end-March 2015, due in  large part to ongoing fiscal consolidation. 
14 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 
rule that provides room for counter-cyclical fiscal policy. In the meantime, pro-growth fiscal policy  could be practiced by further improving the quality and efficiency of public expenditure.  
27. Implementing a robust goods and services tax (GST), improving revenue  administration, and undertaking further subsidy reforms are policy priorities. Specifically,  staff recommends the following measures:  
· Tax reform. India’s revenue-to-GDP ratio remains considerably below its emerging market  peers. The long-awaited GST should be implemented, as it would create a single national market,  enhance the efficiency of intra-Indian movement of goods and services and boost GDP growth. As  envisaged by the authorities in the recent Subramanian Committee recommendations, the GST  should have minimal exemptions and a moderate single rate. Progress towards a new direct tax  code, with smaller and streamlined deductions, would also help. Efforts to improve tax  administration (as envisaged in the Tax Administration Reform Commission reports) should be  stepped up as the scope for revenue gains is large. Staff supports the Finance Minister’s plans to  lower the corporate income tax rate while eliminating exemptions.  
· Subsidy reform. Overhauling India’s subsidy regime should continue via better targeting,  improving efficiency, and reducing distortions. Untargeted food subsidies should be pared back,  including by rationalizing the list of eligible beneficiaries and reforming the inefficient Food  Corporation of India (FCI)—see Box 5 and Selected Issues Chapter VI. The current approach to  non-food subsidy payments, namely direct benefit transfers, increased financial inclusion, and use  of the Aadhaar system to better identify beneficiaries, should continue to yield large fiscal savings.  
Authorities’ Views  
28. The authorities were confident that the central government fiscal deficit target for  this year will be met. They noted that revenue performance has been healthy, and reforms to the  timing of public infrastructure spending make bunching of expenditures at the end of the fiscal  year somewhat less likely. Lower world oil prices have given India the opportunity to recast its fuel  subsidy architecture, eliminating waste while focusing scarce resources more effectively on the  truly needy. The authorities pointed to high-quality reforms to gasoline, diesel, LPG, kerosene and  fertilizer subsidy programs that, even as recently as three or four years ago, were unimaginable. 
29. While acknowledging that meeting the deficit targets for FY2016/17 and beyond  will be challenging, the authorities did not agree that fiscal adjustment has paused this  year. They noted that the Seventh Pay Commission mandate, combined with the need to kick start the investment cycle with public infrastructure spending, could make it difficult to achieve  the deficit target of 3½ percent of GDP for FY2016/17. The GST is not likely to be implemented  quickly, certainly not from the previously-planned April 2016, although it will support revenue  performance over time. Even though the rate structure of the GST is likely to be revenue neutral,  the authorities anticipated that a good GST design will support revenue administration  improvements by encouraging firms to join the formal economy to take advantage of input tax  credits. The authorities took note of staff’s view that continued fiscal adjustment remains  appropriate, given India’s still-high general government deficit, even after recent consolidation

INDIA 
efforts, though they argued that India’s revenue/GDP ratio is comparable with countries having a  similar level of per capita GDP.  
D. Maintaining External Stability  
30. India’s external position is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and  desirable policy settings, and reserves are assessed to be adequate (Box 11 and Annex IV:  Assessing Reserve Adequacy). International reserves have increased by $48 billion since April 2014,  standing at US$352 billion at end-December 2015 (slightly above 150 percent of the Fund’s reserve  adequacy metric and around 8 months of import cover).27 The build-up of reserves was driven by  robust capital inflows (both FDI and FPI flows), although these have tapered off since April 2015.  Foreign exchange (FX) intervention continues to be guided by the need to limit excessive volatility.  Notwithstanding the reduction in external vulnerabilities, there is a need for vigilance given sharp  movements in global commodity prices, potential volatility of global financial market conditions, and  the deterioration in India’s export performance.  
31. In the event of a surge in global financial market volatility, India should continue to  rely on exchange rate flexibility as a key shock absorber. To minimize disruptive movements  in the currency divorced from fundamentals, continued exchange rate flexibility could be  accompanied by judicious FX intervention (which can be in spot and forward markets, and via  liquidity provision through swaps).  
32. India faces a challenge in increasing exports. The contraction in merchandise exports has  been partly due to the collapse in commodity prices, as refined petroleum products made up about  20 percent of the value of goods exports in 2014/15. The slowdown in global demand has also  affected India’s exports, as potentially has the appreciation of the rupee real effective exchange rate.28 Achieving a significant export acceleration (as envisaged in the Foreign Trade Policy blueprint) would  need to be underpinned by measures to reduce barriers to trade and lower the cost of doing business.  Continued progress on alleviating supply-side bottlenecks would help enhance the effectiveness of  exchange rate flexibility in lessening the impact of adverse external shocks, as well as in boosting  exports in the long-term.  
33. While India’s external financing requirements have declined, further enhancing the  environment for attracting stable, non-debt creating capital flows, particularly FDI, remains  important. In the past year, several steps toward this goal have been taken, including by  liberalizing caps on FDI inflows in several sectors (among them railways infrastructure,  construction, defense, and insurance). This has resulted in US$35 billion of FDI flows in calendar  
27 See also Selected Issues Chapter V for measures of capital account openness.  
28 The IMF’s World Economic Outlook projects that the volume growth of non-oil import demand in India’s major  trading partners will average about 5½ percent during the next five years, significantly below the near 10 percent  growth rate recorded during 2001–08. Using the average estimated income elasticity of 1.5, in the absence of  further measures to enhance competiveness, India’s merchandize export growth will likely remain below 10  percent per annum (see Box 7 and M. Raissi and V. Tulin (2015), “Price and Income Elasticity of Indian Exports: Role  of Supply-Side Bottlenecks,” IMF WP 15/161).

INDIA 
2015 to October, up from US$29 billion during the same period in 2014, more than  counterbalancing the CAD. In addition, limits for foreign portfolio investors’ (FPI) purchases of  government bonds have been increased from January 1, 2016, which have the potential to bring  in an additional US$2.5 billion of inflows in the bond market in Q1 of 2016, if fully taken up.  Nonetheless, a more conducive business environment is necessary to attract greater FDI and help  the success of the “Make in India” initiative. Debt inflows, particularly in the form of external  commercial borrowings (ECBs) by Indian corporates, have increased in recent years (though not in  2014/15), nonetheless India’s external debt remains low at 24 percent of GDP at end-September  2015. Further liberalization of ECBs should proceed cautiously and be carefully monitored by the  RBI, given the vulnerabilities of corporate balance sheets.29 30 
Authorities’ Views  
34. The authorities agreed that external vulnerabilities are now much lower. Like staff,  they foresee a current account deficit of about 1½ percent of GDP for 2015/16, easily financed by  FDI. They also agreed that reserves are at a healthy level, and the exchange rate is both flexible  and broadly fairly valued. The recent slowdown in exports notwithstanding, the authorities were  not overly concerned about near-term competitiveness. Nonetheless, they emphasized the  importance of structural reforms, ease of doing business, and infrastructure investments to ensure  that India’s external outlook remains healthy over the medium term.  
E. Structural Policies to Boost Growth and Employment  
35. Priority areas for reforms are well known: addressing long-standing supply  bottlenecks, labor and product market reforms, and improving the business climate.  Building on recent progress, key measures include:  
· Power reforms. Strengthening the UDAY scheme for state power distribution companies to  mitigate the risk of moral hazard, including through strong conditionality aimed at reducing  transmission losses and raising power tariffs when needed. Additional reforms should also be  informed by India’s commitments under the Paris climate change agreement (see Box 12).  
· Land reforms. Streamlining and expediting land acquisition and simplification of procedures, at  both the center and state levels.  
· Labor market reforms. Greater labor market flexibility and product market competition remain  essential to create jobs and raise growth. Recent steps by several states to increase labor market  flexibility are welcome. Such reforms are key for increasing employment in the formal sector and  employment of women, broadening the manufacturing base, and taking advantage of India’s  favorable demographics (see Selected Issues Chapter VII).  
29 The RBI announced relaxed rules in late-September 2015, which allow Indian companies to issue local-currency denominated bonds overseas. These so-called Masala bonds transfer currency risk to foreign investors, will  potentially open up new sources of funding for Indian firms, and broaden the set of Indian firms with access to  offshore borrowing.  
30 The RBI also announced in September 2015 that a gradual increase in the foreign investor quota for domestic  government bonds will be implemented from October 2015. The increase in limits for government securities will  be announced every half year, and will be released every quarter. 
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17 
INDIA 
· Strengthening the business climate. Efforts to improve India’s business climate should  continue. Staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to improve India’s ranking on the World  Bank’s Doing Business indicators, particularly in the underperforming areas of resolving  insolvency and enforcing contracts. Staff supports the recent introduction of state-based  doing business indicators, which will encourage cross-state competition in attracting  investment.  
Other reforms. As elaborated in the 2015 India Article IV Staff Report, other key reform areas include: (i)  rationalizing natural resource allocation; (ii) reorienting public expenditure towards growth-enhancing  and social spending; and (iii) agricultural sector reforms, including reform of the Food Corporation of  India (see the recommendations of the FCI Committee and Box 5). The above reforms are needed to  raise potential growth, which is critical for poverty reduction in India.31 
Authorities’ Views 
36. The authorities concurred with staff that structural reforms are critical to boosting  India’s growth prospects. They felt that the UDAY power sector debt restructuring scheme  would not give rise to moral hazard, and they noted that coal sector reforms had been successful,  including the transparent re-auctioning of coal blocks. They welcomed the progress that has been  made in improving India’s ranking in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business survey. Major  international partners, notably Japan, have accelerated efforts to boost the Prime Minister’s “Make  in India” campaign. Finally, the authorities noted that “cooperative federalism” is allowing some  states to introduce major reforms—such as to land, labor, and agricultural markets—which are not  yet politically feasible at the all-India level. Over time, they expected these reforms to fructify into  healthy and inclusive job creation and growth.  
STAFF APPRAISAL  
37. The Indian economy is on a recovery path, helped by a large terms of trade gain,  positive policy actions, improved confidence, and strengthened external buffers. After  bottoming out in 2012, growth has risen steadily with a revival of sentiment. Since late 2014, a  halving of global oil prices has boosted economic activity, underpinned a further improvement in  the current account and fiscal positions, and engendered a sharp decline in inflation. The  important structural reforms that have been initiated will support growth prospects and enhance  the resilience of the Indian economy. At present, however, there remains limited space for  countercyclical macroeconomic policies to counteract the remaining economic slack and respond  to domestic and external shocks.  
38. India’s growth outlook remains favorable, but faces difficult challenges. The  economic recovery is expected to continue to be underpinned by private consumption. Higher  public infrastructure investment and government initiatives to tackle supply-side bottlenecks and  to repair corporate and financial sector strains should help crowd-in private investment.  
31 See R. Anand and V. Tulin (2014), “Defining and Explaining Inclusive Growth and Poverty Reduction,” IMF WP  14/63. 
18 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 
Nonetheless, risks are tilted to the downside. The main risks relate to weak corporate and bank  balance sheets, and renewed global financial market volatility. Continued anemic growth of India’s  trading partners could also weaken the sustainability of the growth recovery. On the upside,  further structural reforms could lead to stronger growth, as would a sustained period of low  global energy prices.  
39. India’s financial system is generally sound, but public sector banks continue to face  asset quality difficulties. The RBI should continue to strengthen asset quality recognition and  increase banks’ provisioning as needed, and continue to monitor corporates’ FX exposures.  Augmenting capital buffers in public banks and implementing corporate governance reforms are  of key importance to ensure the durability of the Indian growth recovery. The introduction of a  Bankruptcy Bill is welcome which, together with strengthening out-of-court debt restructuring,  should pave the way to a robust insolvency resolution regime and also help deepen domestic  capital markets. Efforts should continue to build on India’s commendable progress in financial  inclusion, underpinned by new technologies and expanding the range of financial services.  
40. The monetary stance remains appropriately tight for achieving near-term inflation  objectives. Following the formal adoption of the flexible inflation targeting regime in early 2015,  progress to enhance communication and improve policy transmission continues. Favorable  inflation dynamics gave the RBI room to cut the policy rate, while maintaining positive real  interest rates broadly consistent with the “glide path” towards the medium-term inflation target.  Given upside risks to inflation, a re-emergence of inflationary pressures may require monetary  tightening. Reducing still-high household inflation expectations will require a long period of low  inflation which, unless underpinned by durable measures to boost food supply, may require a  tight monetary stance for longer.  
41. Fiscal consolidation needs to be underpinned by revenue-raising reforms. Although  fiscal consolidation has paused, enhanced capital outlays and important fuel subsidy reforms are  welcome. The medium-term fiscal targets are broadly appropriate, but to achieve them more  efficient taxation (including through introduction of the GST) and further rationalization of  subsidies (fertilizer and food) are essential. While public debt is sustainable, the general  government deficit remains high and constrains the space for much-needed public investments.  
42. International reserves are assessed to be adequate and the external position is  broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals. Notwithstanding the reduction in India’s  external vulnerabilities, there is a need for vigilance given potential volatility in global financial markets,  and the deterioration in India’s export performance. If global financial market volatility resurfaces,  continued exchange rate flexibility could be accompanied by judicious foreign exchange  intervention given India’s increased and adequate reserve buffers. Achieving a significant export  acceleration would need to be underpinned by measures to reduce barriers to trade and lower the  cost of doing business. Further liberalization of external commercial borrowing should proceed  cautiously, given the potential vulnerabilities of corporate balance sheets. 
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19 
INDIA 
43. Addressing long-standing supply bottlenecks, labor and product market reforms,  and improving the business climate are crucial to achieving faster and more inclusive  growth. Enduring improvements in power distribution and natural resource allocation and pricing  will be important in raising potential growth. Further reforms to increase labor market flexibility  and facilitate land acquisition, including at the state level, are key to increasing employment in the  formal sector and broadening India’s manufacturing base.  
44. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12- month cycle.

Box 1. Oil Price Collapse: Impact on Indian Inflation1 
The collapse of oil prices accounts for close to half of the 3½ percentage point decline in Indian CPI  inflation since the first half of 2014. Monetary policy should be watchful of the likely transitory nature  of this decline in inflation.  
Since mid-2014, a halving of global oil prices has boosted economic activity in India and  underpinned further improvement in the current account and fiscal positions and a sharp  decline in inflation. India’s terms of trade have improved by about 9½ percent, largely reflecting  the reduction in imported oil prices (net petroleum imports were 5 percent of GDP in 2013/14). With  deregulation of diesel prices in late 2014, the fuel subsidy bill has been reduced from about ¾ of  one percent of GDP to just 0.1 percent of GDP, while the excise duties on petrol and diesel have  been increased on multiple occasions since late 2014, with fiscal revenue impact of about 0.2 percent  of GDP. Finally, with gasoline and diesel prices now free to move in line with international prices,  their retail prices have declined by around 15–20 percent from mid-2014 levels.  
Staff analysis suggests that the collapse of oil prices could have contributed up to 1¾  percentage points to the decline in headline CPI inflation since mid-2014. Assuming the full  pass-through of lower petroleum-related production costs onto the domestic prices of goods and  services, the direct impact of the 20-percent decline in domestic petroleum product prices on  headline CPI inflation is estimated at about 1  
percentage point.2 Half of this is due to the

contribution of lower consumer expenditure on  65 
petroleum products, which have a weight of about 2.5  60 
percent in the CPI basket. The other half is due to the  direct impact of lower petroleum prices on the  55 
production costs of various goods and services. Finally,  50 
the indirect impact (from lower oil prices reducing the  45 
cost of all other, i.e. non-petroleum, intermediate  40 
inputs) is estimated at nearly ¾ of one percentage  point. In addition, the total impact of a reduction in

petroleum products cost on the WPI inflation is estimated to be significantly larger, at about 3½  percentage points, reflecting the WPI product basket.  
The assessed disinflationary impact should be seen as an upper bound. The implicit assumption  of zero demand price elasticity implies that the decline in petroleum costs is fully passed on to  producer prices rather than into profit margins. Notwithstanding some pickup in FY2015/16 advance  tax payments by India’s largest firms, the underlying improvement in profits may reflect not only  better margins from lower input costs, but also incipient demand recovery, resulting in part from an  oil drop boost to real disposable incomes, in addition to reduced interest costs on account of recent  policy rate cuts. Overall, the oil price drop has clearly led to a significant drop in Indian inflation.  Monetary policy should take this into account, given the likely transitory nature of this decline.  ____________________

Box 2. Oil Glut and the Indian Economy1 
 Following a positive supply-driven oil price shock (with prices falling by about half), growth is  estimated to increase by about 0.3 percentage points and inflation to fall by 80 basis points after  one year.  
This Box investigates the macroeconomic consequences of the recent oil glut for the Indian  economy in terms of its effects on oil prices, real output, inflation and financial markets. To  do this, Mohaddes and Raissi (2015) integrate an oil price equation, which takes account of  developments in the world economy as well as the prevailing oil supply conditions, within a  reduced-form quarterly model of the global economy (the GVAR model for short).2 To distinguish  the oil glut shock (mainly driven by the U.S. oil revolution) from oil demand disturbances, they  employ a set of dynamic sign restrictions on the impulse responses of their GVAR-Oil model  (estimated over 1979Q2-2011Q2). More specifically, they require the oil glut to be associated with:  (i) a decline in oil prices; (ii) an increase in oil production; and (iii) an increase in the sum of real  GDPs across all major oil importers in their sample.  
The results indicate that the collapse of oil prices (which is equivalent to a 2.5 percent of  GDP terms of trade gain for India) leads to higher growth and equity prices, and lower  inflation. Figure 1 shows the estimated median (blue solid) and median-target (black long dashed) impulse responses for up to 40 quarters of key macroeconomic variables of India to a  supply-driven negative oil-price shock, together with the 5th and 95th percentile bands.3 The  results suggest that following the U.S. oil revolution, with oil prices falling by 51 percent in the first  year, Indian growth increases by about 0.3 percentage point after one year—either directly  through higher urban consumption spending and lower input cost for corporate sector or  indirectly from trade with the rest of the world (as global growth increases by 0.2–0.4 percentage  point). The oil glut also creates a moderate temporary disinflation pressure in India (80 basis  points on an annualized basis over 4 quarters) and boosts equity prices over the medium-term.

Box 3. India’s Progress on Structural Reforms1 
Progress on structural reforms has been made in recent years, and India has done more than several other  emerging market countries and many advanced economies. Still, expedited progress on structural reforms will  be important to achieving stronger growth.  
India faces several structural impediments to growth. These include: rigidities in product and labor  markets; inefficient pricing and allocation of natural resources; an uncertain and burdensome business  environment, including difficulties in acquiring land and regulatory clearances; and inefficient agricultural  markets, including in the public system for food procurement, distribution, and storage.

OECD countries, BRIICS (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China, and South Africa) countries were active in  financial market reform.  
The indicator shows that India has achieved more of the recommended reforms from 2011 to 2014  than other BRIICS. India has taken steps to ease barriers to domestic and foreign competition in the  banking sector. Recent actions to increase banking competition in India include issuing new bank licenses,  liberalizing branch licensing, and guidelines on differentiated licenses for payment banks and small banks.  In addition, a process of reviewing the current regulatory architecture and replacing most of the existing  financial laws began in 2011, and a revised draft of a new Indian Financial Code was recently completed. In  response to the slowdown in infrastructure investment in 2011/12, a process of reforms began which  include: setting up a Cabinet Committee on Investments to streamline approvals, streamlining coal block  auctioning, financial restructuring of state electricity distribution companies, allowing FDI of up to 100  percent in railway infrastructure, and tax-free infrastructure bonds for projects in the rail, road and irrigation  sectors. The overall trend has been to increase the caps on allowed foreign investment, simplify regulations,  and to move towards market-based pricing of natural resources. For example, gasoline and diesel prices  were deregulated in 2010 and 2014 and the formula that fixes the price of natural gas is now revised every  six months. First steps on labor market flexibility have been taken by the center—making it easier to comply  with labor regulations and removing certain restrictions on overtime and women working night shifts—and  in several Indian states.

Box 4. Crowding-Out or Crowding-In? Public and Private Investment In India1 
Since the mid-1990s, public investment, especially in infrastructure, has a significant positive impact on private  investment in India.  
Reviving public investment, as a key engine of growth, is an important objective of Indian policy-making.  The FY2015/16 Budget, in particular, focuses on investment in infrastructure, both through higher on-budget  outlays as well as initiatives to facilitate off-balance sheet financing—including implementation of the National  Investment and Infrastructure Fund and permitting tax-free infrastructure bonds. Moreover, recognizing the  subdued private investment outlook, the rationale for the public investment thrust is not only to enhance long-term  productive capacity of the economy but also to complement the private investment revival in the short-term.  
Staff research suggests that public investment has a long-lasting impact on output and has become  complementary to private investment in India. First, using a theory-based structural vector error-correction  model differentiating long-run and short-run dynamics, it is shown that a policy-induced change in public  investments has a statistically significant positive impact on output. Second, reflecting major structural changes that  the Indian economy has undergone during the 1980s and early 1990s, the interaction between private and public  investment during the past three decades has changed from “crowding out” to “crowding in”, see Figure 1. Third,  public investment initiatives that target the infrastructure sector and those that result in completion tend to have  more pronounced positive impact on both economic output and private investment.2 
Notwithstanding a strong public investment impetus, policy  challenges remain. Interim multiplier estimates suggest that  40 
one additional rupee in public investment leads to an increase of  35

Box 5. India: Reorienting the Role of the Food Corporation of India (FCI)1 
FCI reform is needed to reduce the rate and volatility of food inflation, incentivize growth of agricultural productivity, raise  efficiency of grain markets, and better serve economically vulnerable households.  
In the past few years, the FCI’s dominant role2 in the market of cereals has come under increasing public criticism  which pinpointed market distortions, large leakages in the Public Distribution System (PDS),3 and operating  inefficiencies. The FCI was established in 1965 as India faced major shortages of grains to stabilize markets through  procurement, distribution, and maintenance of buffer stocks for food security and price stability purposes. Over time, as  production increased substantially, India has emerged as a net cereal exporter and the largest exporter of rice in the  world, while it has also built a cushion of massive buffer stocks of cereals. In addition, a particular area of policy criticism  has been FCI’s buffer stock practices which, as a result of essentially open-ended procurement and strong price  incentives, have resulted in excessive buffer stocks that have been accompanied by high food inflation. The  recommendations of the Shanta Kumar Committee Report on Reorienting the Role and Restructuring of FCI aim at  refitting the PDS and revisiting the National Food Security Act (NFSA) to better serve the economically vulnerable  households, improving operational efficiency, and implementing a pro-active buffer stock liquidation policy.  
Excessive cereal stock hoarding and a lack of pro-active buffer stock liquidation resulted in sustained inflationary  pressures. Although government’s proactive response to a surge in global food prices during 2007-08 helped limit the  impact on domestic food prices, cereals buffer stocks fell significantly below the norms. In subsequent years, however,  excessive stock hoarding took place, supported in part by effectively open-ended procurement and strong growth of  minimum support prices. Rice and wheat intake into the Central Pool between 2007/08 and 2012/13 averaged around 4  and 7 percent of annual output, respectively, while growth of minimum support prices averaged about 13 percent per  year. As a result, during the last five years actual buffer stocks held with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) averaged  more than double the norms. Substantial increases in the minimum support price were generally followed by rising  inflation in key agricultural crops, fueling inflationary pressures. In addition, the inefficiencies of the buffer stock policy have been aggravated by the significant costs of carrying excess stocks, as the FCI’s costs of acquiring, storing, and  distributing food grains have been 40 to 50 percent more than the procurement prices.  
Staff research suggests that pro-active intake and liquidation of  stocks can smooth consumption and stabilize prices. A counter 12 
factual buffer stock policy scenario entailing (i) lower cumulative buffer  10 
stock intake during 2007–2012 in accordance with the revised buffer

policy (smoothing the growth rate of cereal consumption at around 1½

Pro-active buffer  stock policy scenario assumes (i) implementation of revised buffer stock norms by  mid-2013, and (ii) smoothing of growth rate of cereals' consumption at slightly  below 1½ percent per year through intake and release of buffer stocks.
2 The share of public procurement has risen substantially in recent years, from an average of about 25 percent during 2002/03- 2007/08 to about 32 percent during 2008/09–2013/14. The share of PDS purchases in consumption has also increased  considerably.

Box 6. Gold: Macro-Financial Linkages1 
While import demand for gold is mainly affected by inflation, international gold prices, and financial  inclusion, the Government of India’s recently announced gold schemes could lower gold imports by about  10 percent annually if implemented successfully.  
Persistently-high inflation (depressing real returns) prompted a surge in gold imports in  FY2011/12, which subsequently led to a marked deterioration in India’s current account balance. India is the world’s second-largest consumer of gold (about a quarter of world demand), and depends  heavily on imported gold which meets about 90 percent of its domestic demand.2 Gold imports  reached a record high in FY2011/12 (US$56 billion, or 3 percent of GDP) and remained elevated in  FY2012/13, contributing to the widening of current account deficit to 4.8 percent of GDP in FY2012/13.  They were sharply curtailed in FY2013/14 before partially rebounding in FY2014/15 with the  liberalization of administrative restrictions on their import.3 As domestic inflation and international gold  prices have fallen, and financial inclusion has been improved, import demand for gold has remained  below the FY2011/12 highs.

The government has recently announced two schemes to reduce gold imports: a Gold  Monetization Scheme (GMS) and a Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) scheme. While the GMS intends  to bring the private holdings of gold into circulation, and reduce the reliance on gold imports (as  domestic recycling improves), the SGBs scheme aims at converting the investment demand for gold  (estimated at about 300 tons annually) into paper demand. If successful (see Selected Issues Chapter III  for pre-requisites), these schemes could lower gold imports by about 10 percent annually.  ________________________

2 This reflects a deep cultural affinity for gold and residents’ perception of gold as a “safe” asset. The perception of  safety, coupled with limited availability of alternative investment opportunities, has contributed to a concentration  of household savings in gold-related investments.  
3 On May 13, 2013, the Reserve Bank of India restricted the import of gold by banks on a consignment basis,  followed by the 20:80 scheme on July 22, 2013 under which all nominated banks/agencies were to ensure that at  least 20 percent of every lot of imported gold was exclusively made available for the purpose of exports.

Box 7. India: Export Elasticities and the Role of Supply Rigidities1 
India’s exports are constrained by sluggish external demand. Alleviating supply-side bottlenecks, in the energy sector in particular, is vital for better export performance in the long-run and also for enhancing the  effectiveness of exchange rate flexibility as a shock-absorber in the short-run.  
While Indian exports are sensitive to international relative-price competitiveness and external  demand, binding supply-side constraints (notably energy shortages) dampen price responsiveness  in the short term. Export performance is affected by short-term fluctuations in international relative  prices, with an estimated average elasticity of about -0.5 (see Table 1). Furthermore, non-manufacturing  exports appear to be slightly more demand elastic in the long run, but significantly less price-elastic in  comparison to manufacturing exports. The negative sign of the average short-run income elasticity on  crude materials and chemical products likely reflects India’s net commodity importer status. Finally,  energy shortages may reduce the responsiveness of Indian exports to real depreciation while they appear  not to matter when relative price changes are unfavorable.

Continued exchange rate flexiblity, as well  as further structural reforms to ease  supply-side bottlenecks, are important for  facilitating exports. In the face of external  shocks, international relative price flexibility,  with the exchange rate as a shock absorber,  can help increase India’s exports in the short  run. In addition, continued progress on  alleviating supply-side bottlenecks, in the  energy sector in particular, would help  enhance the effectiveness of exchange rate  flexibility in lessening the impact of adverse  external shocks as well as in boosting exports  in the long-term.

Box 8. Spillovers to India from China’s Rebalancing1 
A one percent permanent negative GDP shock in China could have major global macroeconomic  repercussions (with world growth falling by ¼ of one percentage point), but its impact on India is limited.  
This Box investigates empirically how shocks to GDP in China are transmitted to India, conditional  on alternative configurations of cross-country linkages in the global economy. A dynamic multi country model (Global VAR) is used to determine the size and speed of the transmission of China GDP  shocks to India. This framework consists of 26 region-specific models (including a single Euro Area  region comprising 8 of the 11 countries that adopted the euro in 1999). These individual models are  solved in a global setting where core macroeconomic variables of each economy are related to  corresponding foreign variables (constructed exclusively to capture each country's bilateral exposures to  the other countries due to trade and financial linkages). Spillovers are transmitted across economies via  trade, financial, and commodity price channels. The model has both real and financial variables: real  GDP, inflation, the real equity price, the real exchange rate, short and long-term interest rates, and the  price of oil. All data are quarterly in frequency, for the period 1979Q2 to 2013Q1.  
The results show that output shocks emanating in China have important global effects, but their  impact on India is limited (likely due to India’s narrow trade/financial exposures to China). A  permanent one percent decline in China’s real GDP would translate into lower overall growth globally.  Countries most heavily exposed to China’s  2715259625485
growth slowdown are those within the Asian  
regional supply chain and commodity  
exporters (following the China shock, the  
price of oil falls by about 6½ percent). After  
one year, the China shock would reduce  
output in Malaysia and Singapore by about  
0.35 percent and in Indonesia and Thailand by  
about 0.3 percent. The effects on the GDP of  
the Euro Area, Japan, UK, and the United  
States are generally smaller. Output in India  
would be affected by less than 0.1 percent  
after one year, as the positive impact of the  
fall in the price of oil partly offsets the decline  
in demand from China (with which India has weak trade links) and that of India’s other trading partners  (which are themselves adversely affected by the GDP shock in China). Note that the approach taken here  not only accounts for direct exposures of countries to shocks but also indirect effects through secondary  or tertiary channels. Nonetheless, if the shock to China’s GDP is combined with a spike in global financial  market volatility (leading to exchange rate pressures, higher bond yields and lower equity prices), the  impact on most countries, including India, would be significantly larger.2

Box 9. Corporate and Banking Sector Vulnerabilities1  
Past deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and supply-side bottlenecks, particularly in infrastructure, have  led to the build-up of high corporate vulnerabilities, with a strong negative impact on banks’ asset quality. Banks  face potential recapitalization needs. Staff estimates that these should be manageable, but may require further  fiscal outlays.  
The vulnerabilities of the Indian corporate sector remain high, reflected in profitability pressures and  high leverage, particularly among large corporates. Supply side bottlenecks—particularly in infrastructure,  and the iron and steel sectors—continue to affect negatively corporate profitability. The median return on  assets (ROA) of Indian corporates has continued to decline and at 4.6 percent in FY2014/15 was the lowest over  the past decade. Corporate leverage is now one of the highest across emerging market economies, with  leverage of the largest corporates (top 1 percent) persistently higher than for other firms. The median debt-to equity ratio of the top corporates (on a gross debt basis) has been at more than 175 percent each year since  FY2008/09, relative to less than 130 percent for other firms (245 percent and 113 percent at end-FY2015,  respectively; see Selected Issues Chapter I).  
Stress tests of corporate balance sheets confirm that exposure to potential shocks is high. Corporates’  debt repayment capacity, after improving in FY2013/14, showed signs of marginal deterioration in FY2014/15.  Corporate debt-at-risk—the share of debt owed by firms with an interest coverage ratio (ICR) below one— edged up to 10.8 percent, following an improvement to 10.2 percent in FY2013/14 (Figure).2 An upward shift in  domestic interest rates continues to be a key risk for Indian corporates, with the share of debt-at-risk estimated  to increase to 17 percent in case of a 250 basis point rise in

banks (PSBs)—including gross non-performing assets (NPAs) and restructured assets—in total advances  increased to 13.5 percent at end-March 2015 from 11.9 percent a year earlier. A significant share of stressed  loans—more than 41 percent—are concentrated in the infrastructure and iron and steel sectors, which have  been impacted adversely by the domestic supply-side issues and by export headwinds. With reform measures  to address structural bottlenecks, new NPA formation may decelerate. However, the accumulation of  restructured loans, which accounted for 8.1 percent of PSBs’ total loans at end-FY2014/15, poses a challenge.  These loans, while not classified as non-performing, have modified terms to ameliorate possible borrower  debt repayment difficulties, and hence imply substandard quality. Further transition of restructured loans to  NPA status, and the need to provision new restructured loans at the NPA provisioning rate, coupled with the  phase-in of Basel III capital requirements by March 2019, are expected to necessitate additional capital  injections in the PSBs in the coming years.  
Banking sector stress-test simulations suggest that potential recapitalization needs should be  manageable, but may require further fiscal outlays. The simulations evaluated the impact of further  deterioration in loan quality on banks’ capital base, assuming a 15 percent transition of restructured advances  to NPAs in each year to end-FY2018/19, and minimum 60 percent provisioning against NPAs. The analysis was  carried out on a bank-by-bank basis, with slippage, recovery and write-off rates calibrated on banks’ recent  performance, and using the Tier 1 capital ratio as a hurdle rate (including the 2.5 percent capital conservation  buffer (CCB) and additional buffers of up to 2 percent). Even in a severe scenario of continuous deterioration  of PSBs’ asset quality on a scale commensurate with their recent experience, recapitalization costs should be  manageable, at 2.9 percent of FY2018/19 GDP (cumulative over four years, including a 2 percent extra buffer;  left Table).4 Costs are more modest, at 1.8 percent of FY2019 GDP, in the case of further reforms (right Table).  Such milder stress is associated with an about 4 percentage-point decline in PSBs’ median Tier 1 ratio and a  1.7 percentage-point rise in the median NPL ratio. However, these estimates may be subject to downward  bias, given remaining forbearance on the classification of certain loans as restructured.

Box 10. Expanding Financial Inclusion in India1  
The ambitious agenda of the Indian government to extend financial access to the unbanked segments of the  population has accounted for a sizable rise in new bank accounts. Further policies should seek to boost  transactional volumes in these accounts, including via digitalization and better financial literacy.  
In an effort to enhance financial services availability, curb inequality and boost domestic growth,  the government of India has made financial inclusion a key national priority. The financial inclusion  
agenda—Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)— envisages universal access to basic banking services by 2018.  
250 
The number of PMJDY bank accounts to previously  
200 
unbanked persons has increased sharply to 198 million at  
150 
end-December 2015, from less than 54 million in September  
100 
2014, split at 40-60 percent between rural and urban areas

with 154,000 points of presence across villages, is expected to act as a key agent for banks. To incentivize  use of the accounts, there has been a gradual channeling of add-on services, including debit cards and  direct benefit transfers (DBT; e.g., subsidies, and direct cash payments for social programs), as well as  bundling of life and accident insurance, and pension products.2 Women are explicitly targeted under the  scheme, with overdraft facilities and other benefits provided on a priority basis to the wife in each family.  In April 2015, the Government of India also set up Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) to provide  refinancing for micro-finance institutions that lend to small and medium-sized unbankable businesses,  primarily of scheduled castes (CS) and scheduled tribes (ST), with schemes targeting various growth stages  and funding needs.  
Propelling further financial inclusion hinges on enabling sufficient transactional volumes on PMJDY  accounts, digitalization, and more extensive financial literacy. The number of zero-balance accounts is  still high, at 32 percent of all accounts as of end-December 2015 (Figure). Average balances also remain  small (at about Rs. 1,500) and transactional volumes are limited, reflecting in part the continued prevalence  of cash payments in rural India. Further channeling of subsidies and social payments (e.g., food and  fertilizer subsidies, and health insurance), as well as more points-of-access would facilitate higher use and  transactional volumes.3 Digitalization via the linking of PMJDY accounts to mobile payments—as  envisaged in the government’s Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-mobile phone (JAM) scheme—can offer considerable  efficiency gains through better integration of financial services, ease of use and reduction in costs. Further  mobile internet penetration via the government’s “Digital India” initiative would provide a much needed  impetus, with Post offices already rolling out affordable devices.4 Importantly, concerted efforts to increase  the financial literacy of the poor population which lacks experience with financial products is crucial for  PMJDY’s success.

2 These include Aadhaar-enabled micro-ATMs and RuPay debit cards to replace cash transactions, Pradhan Mantri  Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) on accidental death insurance; Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Beema Yojana (PMJJBY) on  life insurance; Atal Pension Yojana (APY) on defined pension for citizens in the unorganized sector.  3 The government may want to raise commissions on transfers to boost the scheme’s business viability for banks.  4 Mobile internet penetration in India is still limited, with projected 232 million users by end-2015. However, growth  has been brisk, at an estimated 33-34 percent in 2014 and 2015 (see KPMG-FICCI M&E Industry Report 2015).

Box 11. External Sector Assessment1 
Staff assesses that India’s external position is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and  desirable policy settings.  
Current Account and Exchange Rates  
The current account deficit (CAD) narrowed further in FY2014/15, helped by lower commodity-import  prices, and is projected to remain contained at about 1.3 percent of GDP in FY2015/16. As of December  2015, the real effective exchange rate (REER) was about 7 percent higher than the average REER in  FY2014/15, with appreciation pressures coming in part from the terms of trade gain.  
The External Balance Assessment (EBA) CA regression estimates a norm of about -3.9 percent of GDP for  India in FY2015/16. However, in staff’s judgment, global financial markets could not be counted on to  reliably finance a deficit of that size, in light of India’s current (albeit reduced) vulnerabilities. Given the  risks with global financial market volatility, staff assesses that a smaller CA of about -2½ percent of GDP  is a more appropriate norm.2 The underlying CA in FY2015/16, which is the CA adjusted for temporary  factors,3 is estimated to be -2 percent of GDP. Thus, staff assesses the CA gap to be about ½ percent of  GDP, or in a range of –½ to +1½ percent of GDP.  
The EBA Index REER and Level REER regression approaches estimate an overvaluation of about 8 and 12  percent for the 2015 average REER, respectively. Staff assesses the REER gap to be in a range of -5 to  +10 percent.4 
Capital Account Flows and International Investment Position  
India’s financial account is dominated by portfolio equity and FDI flows. Nonetheless, debt flows,  particularly in the form of external commercial borrowings by Indian corporates, have increased in recent  years. Net portfolio debt flows were particularly large in FY2014/15. Given that portfolio debt flows have  been volatile and the exchange rate has been sensitive to such flows and to changes in global risk  aversion, attracting more stable sources of financing would reduce vulnerabilities.  
India’s net international investment position (NIIP) deteriorated slightly to -18 percent of GDP in  FY2014/15, from -12 percent in FY2010/11. Reserves, at US$352 billion at end-December 2015, are  adequate (see Annex IV). India’s external debt, at 24 percent of GDP as at end-September 2015, remains  moderate when compared to other emerging market economies. Moreover, the maturity profile of  external debt is favorable as the share of long-term external debt in total debt is about 80 percent and  the ratio of short-term external debt to foreign exchange (FX) reserves is low. With a CAD of under 2½  percent of GDP projected for the medium term and higher GDP growth, the NIIP-to-GDP ratio is  expected to remain broadly stable.

3 This estimated underlying CA incorporates the EBA-estimated cyclical adjustment, and also takes account of the  temporary impact of higher tariffs on gold imports as well as the temporary part of the terms of trade gain (about ½  of one percent of GDP).  
4 This range incorporates both the implication of the CA gap and the REER regression approaches. The staff assessed  CA gap implies an undervaluation in the range of -7.5 to 2.5 percent for the FY2015/16 average REER.

Box 12. Climate Change in India1 
Given India’s high vulnerability to climate change and dominance of coal-based energy sources, the Government  has pledged to curb emission intensity and to expand renewable energy capacity.  
Global climate change is expected to have a  
significant impact on the Indian economy.2 A  
large proportion of the population relies on climate  
sensitive sectors, such as agriculture. Research  
suggests that India is among the most vulnerable  
countries to extreme climate events, where Bosello  
et. al. (2012)3 estimate that growth could be almost  
4 percentage points lower than potential for a  
1.9ºC increase by 2050.  
At the same time, India is the fourth-largest  
emitter of CO2 in the world, after China, U.S.  
and the EU. India accounted for around 7 percent  
of global emissions in 2014, but in terms of per  
capita emissions, India is among the lowest and its contribution to cumulative global CO<U+0B36> is only 3 percent,  compared to 21 and 18 percent by the U.S. and the EU, respectively. A key concern is the dominance of  inefficient coal-based energy sources (more than 60 percent of electricity is generated by burning coal). With  growing population and economic development, electricity demand is expected to increase rapidly.  
India launched a National Action Plan on Climate Change in 2008 and has made tangible progress. The  action plan includes adaptation and mitigation strategies at national and state levels, with a voluntary goal of  reducing the emission intensity of GDP 20-25 percent below its 2005 level by 2020. Key measures include: (i)  
expanding renewable energy capacity fivefold from 2014 to 2022; (ii) introducing and increasing the clean  energy process on coal; (iii) promoting climate-resilient agriculture systems and smart cities; and (iv)  developing domestic carbon markets. India currently spends 3 percent of GDP on adaptation measures and is  assessed to be on track to achieve its voluntary pledges by the 2014 United Nations Environment Program  Emission Gap Report.  
Absolute CO2 Emissions 
Post 2020, India has pledged to curb emissions intensity  
(1000 million tonnes CO2 emissions) 
12 
by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from its 2005 level. India has  
India US China EU Russia Japan 
targeted to increase the share of non-fossil-based electric  
10 
power capacity from 30 to 40 percent of total power  
8 
generation,4 and to create an additional (cumulative) carbon  
6 
sink of 2.5-3 GtCO<U+0B36>e through forest cover by 2030.  
Preliminary government estimates suggest that achieving  
4 
these targets will require at least $3.5 trillion (at 2014-15

prices) in domestic and foreign investment, and

Annex I. Key Policy Actions 2015–161 
Monetary Policy  
February 3, 2015 SLR: Statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of banks reduced by 50 basis points (bps) to  21.5 percent from 22.0 percent.  
February 20, 2015 Monetary policy framework agreement: The Ministry of Finance and RBI  signed an agreement on a new monetary policy framework that formalized  
flexible inflation targeting as the prime objective of the central bank with  
headline CPI inflation as the nominal anchor. The RBI is now mandated to bring  inflation down to 6 percent by January 2016 and target an inflation of 4 (+/-2)  percent in all subsequent financial years.  
September 29,  2015 
December 18,  2015 
Repo rate: RBI reduced the policy repo rate by 125 bps from 8.00 percent to  6.75 percent in four phases: (i) 25 bps each on January 15, March 4, June 2, 2015;  and 50 bps on September 29—the two cuts in January and March being out-of policy cycle. 
Bank lending rates: The RBI issued fresh guidelines on computing interest rates  on advances based on the marginal cost of funds to be operational effective  April 1, 2016. The guidelines would help improve monetary transmission and  ensure transparency in the methodology followed by banks for determining  interest rates on advances.  
Financial Sector 
June 8, 2015 Strategic debt restructuring scheme: RBI allowed banks to undertake ‘strategic  debt restructuring (SDR)’ by converting loan dues to equity shares to provide  
banks with enhanced capabilities to initiate change of ownership in accounts  
which fail to achieve the projected viability milestones.  
June 12, 2015 Interest Rate Futures: RBI introduced cash settled Interest Rate Futures (IRF) on  5-7 year and 13-15 year Government Securities.  
August 20, 2015 Infrastructure funding: Government approved the framework for setting up of  the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) with an initial corpus of Rs  200 billion with 49 percent government equity contribution to solicit equity  
participation from strategic domestic and foreign partners. Funds would extend  equity support to infrastructure nonbank financial corporations/financial  
institutions that could leverage the additional equity to scale up debt financing  of projects.  
August 14, 2015 Governance of public sector banks: Government launched a seven pronged  plan—Indradhanush—to revitalize the operations of public sector banks. The  
seven elements include more flexibility and professionalism in appointments;  
formation of boards of bureau; enhancing bank capitalization; de-stressing  
stressed assets, strengthening risk control measures and NPA disclosures;  
providing more autonomy in decision making; activating a robust framework of  accountability; and initiating governance reforms.  
August 19, 2015 RBI grants approval to 11 applicants for Payments Bank.

Masala Bond: RBI issued a new framework allowing corporates to issue rupee  denominated pain vanilla (masala) bonds in overseas market with a minimum  maturity of 5-years with end-use restrictions. Accordingly, corporates would be  allowed to borrow up to $750 million under automatic route and anything above  under the approval route, while overseas investors would be eligible to hedge  their exposure in rupee through permitted derivative products of Indian banks.  FPI (Foreign Portfolio Investment) limit: RBI raised the limits for FPI investment  in Government securities, in rupee terms, to 5 percent of the outstanding stock by  March 2018, which is expected to open up room for an additional <U+20B9>1,200 billion.  FPIs have also been permitted to invest in the State Development Loans (SDLs),  up to a limit of 2 percent of the outstanding stock by March 2018, estimated to  an additional <U+20B9>500 billion by March 2018.  
External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) Policy: RBI issued a revised framework  for ECB policy with a view to making it more liberal, with fewer restrictions on end  uses and higher all-in-cost ceiling for long term borrowings and borrowings  denominated in rupee.  
Bankruptcy law: Government introduced the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,  2015 in the Lok Sabha (lower house) that proposes to consolidate the insolvency  resolution process into a single law by repealing/amending multiple laws  currently in operation. The code proposes two separate tribunals to adjudicate  complaints of bankruptcy: (i) the National Company Law Tribunal for companies  and limited liability partnerships firms; and (ii) the Debt Recovery Tribunal for  individuals and partnerships. The process would be managed by licensed  insolvency professional hired by Insolvency Professional Agencies that must close  each case within a time bound period of 180 days, extendable by another 90 days.  The code has provision for an insolvency regulator, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy  Board of India, to maintain oversight over the insolvency resolution process.  Fiscal Policy  
February 28, 2015 Fiscal consolidation: Fiscal consolidation road map was delayed by one year; the  new road map proposes to achieve central government fiscal deficit of 3 percent  of GDP by 2017/18 instead of 2016/17. Accordingly, the fiscal deficit target for  2015/16 has been set at 3.9 percent in place of the earlier 3.6 percent.  
February 28, 2015 Corporate tax: Budget 2015/16 proposed cutting basic rate of corporate tax to  25 percent from current 30 percent over the next four years, accompanied by  
removal of exemptions. The government has published a draft roadmap for public  comment.  
February 28, 2015 Service tax: Service tax rate increased to 14 percent from 12.36 percent. February 28, 2015 Fourteenth Finance Commission recommendation: Government accepted the  recommendation to raise share of states from central pool of taxes to 42 percent  from 32 percent. The government also appointed a sub-group of state chief  
ministers to rationalize centrally sponsored schemes (CSS) to make  
commensurate savings at the centre.  
February 28, 2015 GAAR (General Anti-Avoidance Rule): GAAR on tax avoidance has been  deferred by 2 years; will be effective from April 1, 2017.

MAT: The government accepted the recommendations of the High Level  Committee to exempt minimum alternate tax (MAT) levied on FIIs. Pay Commission: The Seventh Central Pay Commission report submitted to the  government recommended an overall pay increase of 23.55 percent. The  proposed date for implementation of these recommendations is January 1, 2016.  Discoms debt restructuring: The government announced Ujwal Discom  Assurance Yojna (UDAY) scheme to restructure debt owned by state-owned  power distribution companies (discoms) and to set in place a framework to  improve their operational and financial efficiency through monitoring of target  activities related to transmission and distribution losses and periodic tariff  revisions. Under the scheme, states, on a voluntary basis, would be required to  take over 75 percent of the discoms’ debt (as of September 30, 2015) over two  years (50 percent in the first year and 25 percent in the second year) and issue  bonds in the market, which would not be counted within the states’ fiscal deficit  limits for the first two years, FY2015/16 and FY2016/17.

Annex III. India: Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis1 
India’s public debt remains sustainable given manageable interest rate costs and expected recovery  in the economy’s real GDP growth rate (with growth higher than projected in the 2015 Article IV  Staff Report). 2 Under the baseline, assuming gradual fiscal consolidation, the public debt-to-GDP  ratio is forecast to decline gradually to around 61¾ percent of GDP in the medium term from the  current level of about 66 percent, with gross financing needs also declining slightly to about  10¾ percent of GDP in 2020/21. Negative growth shocks represent one of the major risks to the  debt outlook. In addition, realization of contingent liabilities coming from future bank  recapitalization needs and liabilities of the electricity distribution companies may also push the  debt trajectory up above the 70 percent benchmark, before the debt-to-GDP ratio declines  gradually in the medium term. On the other hand, the captive domestic investor base is likely to  mitigate the impact of any real interest rate shocks. India’s external debt, currently at 24 percent of  GDP, remains sustainable. 
1. India’s public debt sustainability analysis is based on the following assumptions: 
· Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth is forecast at 7.3 percent (at market prices) in  2015/16, gradually rising to 7¾ percent in the medium term. CPI inflation is projected to  decline from about 6 percent in 2014/15 to around 5 percent in 2020/21. This baseline  scenario assumes continued implementation of structural reforms that do not require  legislative approval, and a gradual global economic recovery scenario as outlined in the  WEO.  
· Fiscal Assumptions. The 2014/15 central government fiscal deficit came in at 4.0 percent  of GDP (below the authorities’ deficit target of 4.1 percent of GDP), which corresponds to  4.2 percent under the Fund’s definition. Over the medium term, the central government’s  fiscal deficit (as per IMF definition) is expected to decline slowly toward 3.6 percent of  
GDP, while state government deficits should decline to about 2.3 percent of GDP. Staff  projections (which are based on current policies and assume no major legislative  changes) imply that the central government will underperform against its fiscal  adjustment targets.  
o Tax performance, especially for income taxes, is expected to increase slightly as  ongoing administrative measures continue to be implemented and base broadening  is expected to continue. Introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is not  assumed in this baseline, as it requires further legislative changes.

2 The analysis of public debt sustainability is based on the framework developed for market access countries. See  Staff Guidance Note for Public Debt Sustainability Analysis in Market Access Countries, IMF, May 2013. 
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 55 
INDIA 
o At the same time, while savings from reduced fuel subsidies have already been  realized as diesel prices have been deregulated, the planned gradual introduction of  cash transfers should help rationalize spending over the medium term. However, the  Food Security Act and fertilizer subsidies will keep the subsidy bill high.  
o Public banks are expected to be recapitalized to reach Basel III targets (baseline  assumes 0.3 percent of FY2018/19 GDP cumulative over the next four years). Recent  announcements indicate state governments will assume a large portion of the debt  of electricity distribution companies (up to 3 percent of GDP), but since the actual  agreements have not yet been reached, this is incorporated only into the contingent  liabilities shock scenario.  
2. Under the baseline projection, India’s debt ratio and gross financing needs will  enter a gradual declining path from 2016/17. India’s primary deficit is projected to trend  downward and remain below its debt-stabilizing threshold (estimated at 2.9 percent of GDP  
based on the 2020/21 projections) in the projection years. Therefore, gross financing needs are  expected to remain at slightly above 12 percent of GDP in 2015/16 before gradually declining to  about 10¾ percent in 2020/21. Automatic debt dynamics arising from the interest rate-growth  differential will on average reduce the debt ratio by close to 2¼ percentage points per year from  2015/16 to 2020/21. As a result, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to fall from about 66  percent in 2014/15 to 61¾ percent in 2020/21. The medium-term public debt-to-GDP ratio is  about 3 percentage point higher than envisaged in the last Staff Report, reflecting an upward  data revision of the historical public debt path and projected slower nominal GDP growth, in part  as a result of reduced inflation and the adoption of flexible inflation targeting.  
3. India faces relatively low risks to debt sustainability under the baseline, but could  be vulnerable to slower real GDP growth and a contingent liability shock. The heat map  suggests that the debt burden benchmark and the gross financing needs threshold are exceeded  under a contingent liability shock. A contingent liability shock (which could arise from losses at  public banks and debt restructuring of electricity distribution companies)4 pushes the debt-to GDP ratio to around 73 percent in 2016/17 and 2017/18. While not flagged as a main risk by the  heat map, a one-standard deviation shock to real GDP growth increases the debt-to-GDP ratio to  just below 70 percent in 2017/18, only marginally lower than the threshold of 70 percent above  which the heat map flags the risk. Both shocks, however, do not change the downward debt  trajectory in the medium term. Lack of fiscal adjustment is another principal risk to debt  sustainability in India’s context. An unchanged primary balance would slow the debt reduction in  the near term. Finally, the combined macro-fiscal shock also has a large level effect but does not  change the direction of the debt trajectory. As a result, the asymmetric fan chart suggests that  upside risks to debt ratio dominate in the medium term. Overall, risks are mitigated by the fact  that most of the public debt is financed through a captive domestic investor base, the very small  
4 The contingent liabilities shock is customized to reflect: (i) the central government bearing the full cost of PSBs’  recapitalization in a severe stress scenario (about 3 percent of GDP), and (ii) state governments assuming 75  percent of the debt of the electricity distribution companies (about 2.5 percent of GDP). 
56 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 
external debt is mostly from official creditors, and adequate international reserves are available in  the rare case that external financing needs arise. Risks that could improve India’s public debt  sustainability include better tax buoyancy, a GST and a new Direct Tax Code (including  improvements in tax administration) that improve efficiency and lead to near-term revenue gains.  A stronger revival of the economy could also return India to the debt dynamics prevailing before  the global financial crisis.  
4. There is no evidence of a systematic projection bias in the baseline assumptions  and the projected fiscal adjustment is in line with other countries’ experiences. India’s  forecast track record is comparable to that of all other surveillance countries. The median  forecast errors for real GDP growth, primary balance and inflation during 2006–14 are all close to  the median among all surveillance countries. India’s projected fiscal adjustment (an improvement  of around three-quarters of one percentage point in cyclically-adjusted primary balance/GDP  over the medium term) is modest and should be achievable. This magnitude of adjustment is  also in line with other countries’ experiences, with a three-year adjustment in cyclically-adjusted  primary balance at the 64 percentile among all surveillance countries with market access. The  boom-bust analysis is not triggered because India had a negative output gap in 2014/15.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks.  Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being  presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.  
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is  used to project debt dynamics five years ahead. 
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account  balance. 
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2016/17.

Annex IV. Assessing Reserve Adequacy in India1 
This note analyzes the adequacy of international reserves in India using the reserve optimizing  model of Jeanne and Rancière (2011) and the IMF’s risk-weighted reserve adequacy metric. The  results show that India’s international reserves are adequate to cover a broad set of risks.  
India’s international reserves have increased by about $50 billion since end-March 2014,  and stand at $352 billion at end-December 2015. The current account deficit (CAD) of  1.3 percent of GDP in 2014/15 was comfortably financed by capital flows, resulting in an increase  in international reserves. The main capital flows were: (i) inflows from foreign institutional  investors (FII), who made net purchases of Indian equities and debt of about $45 billion in  2014/15; (ii) net FDI flows, at about $33 billion in 2014/15; and (iii) non-resident Indian deposits  and overseas borrowings by banks amounting to $14 billion. The CAD is projected to remain at  about 1.3 percent of GDP in 2015/16.  
Given that any sudden stops or reversal of capital inflows could expose India to significant  risks, holding an adequate level of international reserves is essential for the country to  reduce its vulnerability. India is susceptible to surges in global financial market volatility as well  as commodity-price shocks, and should hold reserves for precautionary purposes. However,  there is little consensus in the literature on what constitutes an adequate level of reserves from a  precautionary perspective. This Annex analyses international reserves in India using the reserve  optimizing model of Jeanne and Rancière (2011), and compares the findings with those of the  IMF’s risk-weighted metric. The results show that India’s international reserve levels are adequate  to cover a broad set of risks.  
The Reserve Optimizing Model of Jeanne and Rancière2: This model describes reserves  accumulation as an optimization problem in which risk-averse policy makers choose the level of  reserves to provide optimal insurance against a sudden stop in consumption, given the cost of  holding reserves. When a sudden stop occurs, external debt cannot be rolled over and output  falls below its long-run growth path. Higher reserves mitigate the fall in output and help smooth  national consumption. However, there is a cost to holding reserves as they yield a lower return  than other assets in the economy. In this model the optimal level of reserves is determined by  the size and probability of the sudden stop, the potential loss in output and consumption, the  opportunity cost of holding reserves, and the degree of risk aversion. Based on a calibrated  version of this model to Indian data, the optimal level of reserves in India is estimated to be just  above the projected actual holdings in 2015 (see Figure 1).

The IMF’s Risk-Weighted Approach3 employs a metric that reflects the relative risk levels of  different potential sources of balance of payments pressure—the relative risk weights are based  on tail event outflows associated with periods of exchange market pressure in different  countries—and assesses how large a stock of reserves might be needed relative to this risk weighted measure, to cover for outflows from different sources. For India the metric is  constructed as 30% of short-term debt + 15% of other portfolio liabilities + 5% of M2 + 5% of  exports. Coverage in the region of 100-150 percent of the metric can be regarded as adequate.  Figure 2 shows India’s reserve coverage against the proposed adequacy range of 100-150  percent (dashed lines). In 2015, the projected level of reserves in India is at 151 percent of the  IMF’s reserve adequacy metric.

The IMF’s ‘unadjusted’ assessing reserve adequacy (ARA) metric is used for India. IMF  (2015) proposes a new ARA metric, the ‘adjusted’ ARA metric, to account for controls on capital  outflows, which should reduce the risk of resident capital flight. The adjusted ARA metric halves  the weight on broad money—the proxy for resident flight—resulting in a lower needed stock of  reserves. This approach is not appropriate for India for two reasons. First, de facto measures  show that India’s integration with international capital markets has increased significantly over  the past three decades.4 Second, the adjusted ARA metric uses a composite index to measure  capital account openness that is based on de jure indices which: (i) tally both inflow and outflow  restrictions; (ii) do not distinguish between controls on residents and non-residents; (iii) count  even minimal registration requirements as restrictions; (iv) do not capture whether controls  would potentially bind in an outflow event; and (v) end in 2012—thus not measuring easing of  restrictions in subsequent years. These indices are not granular enough to measure the extent of

capital account liberalization in India. To deem a lower level of reserves to be adequate as a  result of using a dated and coarse measure of capital controls that has not changed for India  since the early 1990s—even though the capital account has become increasingly open—would  be to go against the spirit of the assessing reserve adequacy exercise.  
Overall, India’s level of foreign reserves is adequate to cover a broad set of risks. However,  international reserves are only one part of a country’s defense against shocks. No one measure is  complete and can fully capture the range of factors that bear on a country’s resilience against  shocks. While it could be argued that a sound macroeconomic and prudential policy framework  is likely more important than reserves in limiting country vulnerabilities, the present uncertainties  in global financial markets related to the prolonged use of accommodative monetary policies by  advanced economies may warrant holding a higher level of reserves than suggested by the IMF’s  reserve adequacy framework.  
Assessment of reserve adequacy should also take into account a central bank’s other  external buffers, such as forward FX liquidity positions and bilateral/multilateral swap  lines. The RBI has purchased about $36 billion in both spot and forward markets from January to  November 2015. As at end-November 2015, the net outstanding forward FX purchases of the RBI  stood at $1.5 billion. The net forward position was negative $3 billion. RBI’s reserve holdings, net  of forwards, compares favorably with other EMs (see text chart on the right). Regarding other  lines of defense, the RBI and Bank of Japan have a Currency Swap Arrangement of $50 billion,  and the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) have a Contingent Reserve  Arrangement (CRA) of $18 billion.

Annex V. Subsidy Reform Progress1 
Subsidy reforms have played an important role in fiscal consolidation efforts of the past few years. Better  targeting, improving efficiency, and reducing distortions are imperative for further rationalization of subsidies.  
The major subsidies of the Government of India, for the first time in a decade, are expected to dip  below 2 percent of GDP in 2015-16. The Government provides major subsidies for food, fertilizer and  
petroleum products. The strong reform efforts over the  last year and a half have resulted in a drastic decline in  3.5 
the subsidy bill, primarily on account of reduced fuel  3.0 
subsidies.

government’s fiscal position is thus likely to remain limited. Digitization and biometric seeding of Public  Distribution System (PDS) beneficiaries are being pursued all over the country. In addition, some pilot  experiments for cash transfers are being carried out in selected urban areas. In this regard, in addition to  enhancing the PDS until the full NFSA rollout, the High Level Committee on restructuring of the Food  Corporation of India (FCI) has recommended bringing down the coverage rate to about 40 percent which is  more than adequate to cover the below-poverty-line households.  
Reforms have been recently implemented to help reduce energy subsidies and prevent their recurrence.  These measures include:  
· Gasoline and diesel prices were deregulated in 2010 and 2014, respectively, and now move in line with  international prices. Excise duties on petrol and diesel have been raised on multiple occasions over the  past year.  
· The formula for fixing the price of natural gas also has been revised and gas prices have been raised,  with a provision to revise prices every six months. LPG subsidies have been reduced and fixed on a per  cylinder basis, and since early 2015 delivered via the direct benefits transfer scheme with nationwide  coverage. The nationwide introduction of the modified direct cash transfers scheme for LPG (PAHAL scheme) yielded an estimated 10 to 20 percent subsidy bill savings, in part as a result of de-duplication  initiatives and reduced leakages. While around 3 million households have given up cash subsidy under  the “Give it Up” campaign, LPG subsidies have remained untargeted and in practice highly regressive.  
· Both allocation and distribution reforms are being pursued in the kerosene sector; and the Indian  states are being incentivized to undertake distribution reforms to improve targeting to the needy.  
As allocation and distribution reforms are rolled out, the under-recovery burden of the oil companies is  expected to be completely eliminated, which will help free up resources towards exploration and investment  activities. With the ensuing substantial reduction in the fuel subsidy bill, the drop in international oil prices  presents an opportunity to increase fuel taxation levels to generate additional indirect tax revenues and raise

the overall tax ratio. In addition, staff research suggests that from an economic efficiency perspective, fuel  taxation in India remains significantly below the levels that would internalize negative externalities relating to  pollution, traffic accidents, and global warming.2

New Urea Policy 2015-19 targets increasing domestic production and fertilizer use efficiency, however,  savings are likely to be modest and key distortions remain  
largely unaddressed. With regard to the Nutrient Base Subsidy  policy, movement control of phosphorus and potassium (PK)  fertilizers has also been liberalized by merging the freight  subsidy with the nutrient subsidy on pro-rata basis. Mainly  technology-driven, combined fertilizer subsidy bill savings are  expected to amount to less than 0.1 percent of GDP over the  next four years. In addition, there are plans for a phased  introduction of direct benefit transfers. However, the Maximum  Retail Price of urea, which accounts for about three-quarters of  the fertilizer subsidy bill, has been kept essentially unchanged

for over a decade and is heavily subsidized—both relative to costs and relative to PK-fertilizers—which has  resulted in unbalanced fertilizer use and leakages.  
Subsidy rationalization reforms should to be underpinned by the JAM3 trinity (financial inclusion,  biometric identification and use of mobile technology) and better targeting. As at end-December 2015,  Aadhaar coverage has reached over 950 million persons, and the number of Jan-Dhan Yojana bank accounts  now exceeds 198 million. Aadhaar has proved instrumental in enabling better access to banking services. The  JAM trinity is being contemplated as the next important initiative. In this regard, greater use of 2011/12 Socio Economic and Caste Census could help improve welfare outcomes across the regions and social groups and to  monitor impact, particularly as the federal government embarks on implementing the recommendations of the  Fourteenth Finance Commission by enabling greater revenue sharing with the states and also downsizing  centrally-sponsored schemes.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:  
As per the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), the  exchange rate in India is classified as floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined in the  interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes at times. The RBI’s role is to  modulate excessive volatility so as to maintain orderly conditions. On August 20, 1994, India  accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement. India  maintains the following restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current  international transactions, which are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a):  restrictions related to the nontransferability of balances under the India-Russia debt agreement;  restrictions arising from unsettled balances under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with  two Eastern European countries; and a restriction on the transfer of amortization payments on loans  by non-resident relatives. The Executive Board has not approved these restrictions.  
Article IV Consultation:  
The previous Article IV consultation discussions were held in December 2014. The Staff Report (IMF  Country Report No. 15/61) and associated Selected Issues (IMF Country Report No. 15/62) were  discussed by the Executive Board on February 13, 2015.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP  
In Bank FY15 (July 1, 2014–June 30, 2015), IBRD/IDA lending in India totaled US$3.8 billion (of which  US$2.1 billion IBRD and US$1.7 billion IDA). IFC committed US$1.3 billion in FY15. The World Bank  Group’s (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for India for 2013-20171 focuses on helping India  accelerate poverty reduction and boost shared prosperity, and is closely aligned the Government’s  12th Five-Year Plan, and its goal of “faster, sustainable, and more inclusive growth.” To make a  meaningful contribution to India’s many development challenges, the volume of WBG support— from IBRD, IDA, and IFC—should reach $4 billion annually over the five-year period of the CPS.  
Under the Strategy, the WBG aims to contribute to India’s development by deepening and  strengthening engagement in three priority areas: integration, rural-urban transformation and  inclusion. “Integration” seeks to increase market integration by focusing on addressing infrastructure  gaps and investment climate as key measures needed to help low-income states converge more  quickly with their faster-growing neighbors. With 600 million people expected to live in India’s cities  by 2031, “rural-urban transformation” will require intensified engagement to improve the  management and livability of medium-sized cities. “Inclusion” will entail a stronger focus on human  development with improvements in healthcare systems and nutrition, on the quality of education at  all levels, as well as on better access to finance and social protection for the underprivileged. A  common theme across these three areas of engagement will be an emphasis on improved  governance, sustainability, and gender equality.  
Two key strategic shifts are central to the WBG program in India: increased support to 14 low income and special category states2 and to urbanization. The Bank is working with the Government  to rebalance its lending portfolio, so that 30 percent of all IBRD/IDA lending will be directed to these  states, which together account for 61.5 percent of India’s 270 million people living in poverty. Many  of these states also have human development indicators—high infant mortality, high child  malnutrition, low female literacy—on par with the poorest countries in the world. IFC’s LIS  investment portfolio covers a broad range of sectors, complemented its advisory services.  Engagement in more advanced states and at the central level will focus on activities that are  transformative and innovative. Urbanization presents tremendous opportunities, both for agriculture  and poverty reduction, and competitiveness. WBG support focuses on government efforts at the  national, state and city levels to help improve the livability of medium-sized cities.  
A robust knowledge portfolio complements and underpins financing and includes: (i) focus on in depth analytical work on key cross-sectoral questions; (ii) inform design and implementation of  future interventions by drawing on impact evaluations; (iii) respond quickly and flexibly with  demand-driven technical assistance and just-in-time knowledge support to help reform and  implementation; (iv) broker South-South and across-state knowledge exchanges; (v) develop flexible  programmatic approaches to develop analytic and advisory activities; and (vi) scale-up training    
1 See http://openindia.worldbankgroup.org for a visualization on the WBG country strategy.  2 Low-income and special category states include: Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha,  Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and eight northeast states (Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram,  Sikkim, and Uttarakhand). IFC excludes Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION  
January 26, 2015 
KEY ISSUES  
Outlook and Risks: India’s near-term growth outlook has improved and the balance of  
risks is now more favorable, helped by increased political certainty, several policy actions,  
improved business confidence, lower commodity import prices, and reduced external  
vulnerabilities. Nonetheless, high inflation expectations and wide fiscal deficits remain key  
macroeconomic challenges, resulting in limited policy space to adopt countercyclical policies.  Supply-side bottlenecks and structural challenges—particularly in the agriculture, mining  
and power sectors—constrain medium-term growth and hinder job creation. Risks are still  
tilted to the downside, with the main external risk stemming from surges in global financial  
market volatility. On the domestic side, a further weakening of bank and corporate balance  
sheets could pose risks to economic recovery and weigh on financial soundness. Sustained  
low global energy prices constitutes an upside risk to growth and downside risk to inflation,  and would help contain both external and fiscal imbalances. 
Key Policy Recommendations:  
· Despite recent moderation in headline inflation, underlying inflationary pressures  
and upside risks remain. Monetary policy should remain tight to reduce inflation and  
inflation expectations durably.  
· Fiscal consolidation should continue. The quality of the consolidation should be  
improved, underpinned by comprehensive tax reform (such as introducing the goods  
and services tax and improving tax administration) and measures to further reduce  
subsidies.  
· To safeguard financial stability in the presence of rising corporate and banking  
sector strains, regulation should be further enhanced, provisioning increased,  
monitoring of corporate vulnerabilities strengthened (especially in light of large  
unhedged FX exposures), and debt recovery by banks further encouraged.  
· Should external pressures from global financial market volatility resurface, rupee  
flexibility is an important shock absorber, complemented by tightening of the  
monetary stance, with foreign exchange intervention limited to preventing excessive  
volatility.  
· While several policy actions have been taken recently, further steps in relaxing long 
standing supply bottlenecks, especially in energy, mining and power sectors, as well  
as labor market reforms, are crucial to achieving faster and more inclusive growth.

2. The decisive outcome of the national elections has buoyed sentiment and boosted  expectations of economic reforms. The Bharatiya Janata Party scored a landslide victory in India’s  parliamentary elections in May 2014. The new government has initiated economic reforms, including diesel  price deregulation and raising natural gas prices, taken steps towards more flexible labor markets,  commenced reforms in the coal sector, and is enhancing financial inclusion (see Text Table 1 on policy  reforms undertaken in fiscal year 2014/15). Nonetheless, much remains to be done to raise potential  growth, particularly in areas of reforming factor and product markets, many of which are on the concurrent  list (areas where the central government and states can legislate), and thus will require consensus building  to implement. Some states have initiated reforms on the concurrent list, such as labor market reforms, and  have requested presidential assent, a modality that could enable states to reform at a faster pace.

3. The recovery is strengthening gradually. Real GDP growth had slowed sharply to around  4½ percent in 2012/13 and 2013/14, as a result of growing imbalances, binding supply constraints, and  subdued sentiment. However, as vulnerabilities  
receded and sentiment revived, growth rebounded to  5½ percent in H1 2014/15, driven by a revival in  
35 
exports, and a rebound in industrial activity. Also, CPI  30 
inflation has receded from 11.2 percent in November  25 
2013 to 5 percent in December 2014. This slowing of  20 
inflation was underpinned by several policy actions,  15 
including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raising the  10 
repo rate by a cumulative 75 bps between September  5

improved near-term growth prospects and lower external vulnerabilities have led to sizable capital inflows,  appreciation of the rupee, and a rise in equity prices to record highs.  
4. Past Fund advice and the authorities’ macroeconomic policies have been broadly aligned,  but progress on structural reforms has been partial. The fiscal deficit target set by the authorities was  met in 2013/14, which staff had endorsed, and staff also supports the authorities’ intentions regarding the  pace of medium-term consolidation. Diesel prices were deregulated and LPG subsidies were capped,  leading to a lower fuel subsidy bill. The stance of monetary policy was tightened in 2013/14 to reduce  inflation, consistent with Fund advice. The RBI has moved to make the containment of inflation its primary  objective, with headline CPI inflation now the principal nominal anchor for monetary policy. Almost all key  recommendations of the 2012 FSAP Update have been implemented (Text Table 2). Progress on product  and labor market reforms has been limited, though some labor market reforms have been initiated by the  center and a few states.  
OUTLOOK AND RISKS  
5. Though India’s near-term growth outlook has improved, its medium-term prospects  
remain constrained by longstanding structural  weaknesses. In the near term, growth is expected  110 
to rebound, helped by increased political certainty,

recovery as projects are implemented. Real GDP growth (at factor cost) is forecast to rise to  5½ percent in 2014/15 (up from 4¾ percent achieved in 2013/14), further accelerating to  6¼ percent in 2015/16, as a result of the revival in industrial and investment activity. In the presence  of supply-side bottlenecks and structural challenges, and assuming no substantial legislative changes,  medium term growth is projected to remain at around 6¾ percent, considerably below the 8 percent  average achieved during 2002–07 (see Box 1 on potential growth).  
6. Inflationary pressures remain, despite recent moderation in headline inflation. CPI  inflation declined to 5 percent in December 2014, reflecting economic slack and favorable base  effects, the tight monetary stance, lower global commodity prices, as well as government efforts to  
contain food inflation. Staff projects CPI inflation to move  up to about 6¼ percent by end-2014/15 and hover slightly

INDIA 
headwinds to growth. Private banks (holding about one-quarter of banking system assets) are well capitalized, profitable, have low NPLs and limited exposure to troubled sectors, and thus will be able  to continue to contribute to credit expansion. However, problems are concentrated in public banks,  where asset quality and capital adequacy positions are at a lower level than in private sector banks.  Given diminished profitability, in order to maintain current capital adequacy ratios (CAR), public  banks will need to improve their capital base to extend sufficient credit to support growth.3 Any  further deterioration in asset quality could thereby constrain banks’ credit supply. Nonetheless,  reflecting buoyant investor sentiment, capital markets (corporate bonds and equities) should be able  to help contribute to financing growth.  
9. Notwithstanding recent improvements, downside economic risks remain (Annex I). On  the external side, despite the reduction in imbalances and strengthening of buffers, the spillover  impact from global financial market volatility to India could be very disruptive, including from any  unexpected developments in the course of U.S. monetary policy normalization, particularly against  the backdrop of recent large capital inflows (see Selected Issues Chapter I). Risks also emanate from  a prolonged period of weak global growth, which could dampen Indian exports. Domestic risks  include a supply-driven spike in inflation (possibly leading to higher gold imports), increased  weaknesses in corporate financial positions, including from significant unhedged foreign exchange  exposures (see Box 2) and further deterioration of bank asset quality, as well as slower-than expected progress in addressing supply-side bottlenecks, which could weigh on growth and stoke  inflation. On the upside, expedited structural reforms and faster implementation of cleared  investment projects could lead to stronger growth, as would sustained low global energy prices.  
Authorities’ Views 
10. There was broad alignment in the macroeconomic projections of staff and the  authorities. The authorities project growth at about 5½ percent in the current fiscal year, given the  better-than-expected monsoon and favorable services sector output, and at slightly over 6 percent in  2015/16, owing to a pickup in global demand, the recovery of mining, and stronger investment. CPI  inflation is projected by the authorities to decline somewhat faster than the RBI’s glide path to  attaining the 6 percent objective by January 2016, reflecting their implementation of comprehensive  structural measures to tackle food inflation. They considered that India’s CAD should remain  contained in the neighborhood of 2 percent of GDP, as gold imports are not expected to revert to  previous highs, reflecting stronger fundamentals.  
11. The authorities believe they are well prepared for a reprise of global financial market  volatility, should it materialize. Fundamentals are stronger, reserves are higher, and markets seem  to be distinguishing India from other major EM economies. They recognize risks to the outlook,  including lower global growth as well as higher oil prices stemming from geopolitical events.  However, they also note that unhedged foreign exchange exposure of corporates—which have  
3 Staff analysis indicates that to finance credit growth in the range of 15–20 percent to support the recovery and  maintain CAR at about 11 percent at public sector banks, capital injection of 0.1–0.2 percent of GDP will be required in  the near term, in addition to the amount allocated in the 2014/15 Union Budget. 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7 
INDIA  
increased during 2014—may not be the major vulnerability some had feared. They perceived the  external volatility of 2013 as having acted as a natural experiment, revealing greater resilience by  corporate India than previously believed. They agreed with staff that rupee exchange rate flexibility is  an important policy tool that helps contain external risks, and noted that they had enhanced the  RBI’s stock of international reserves for precautionary purposes.  
POLICIES: NURTURING THE RECOVERY WHILE  MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC STABILITY  
To secure the recovery and maintain macroeconomic stability, staff recommends a comprehensive medium term policy framework (including measures in the monetary, fiscal, financial and structural areas) that  would raise actual and potential growth, increase policy space, and limit vulnerabilities.  
A. Combating Inflation and Strengthening the Monetary Policy Framework  
12. Since September 2013, to tackle persistently-high inflation, the RBI raised the policy  repo rate, tightened liquidity, and took steps to enhance monetary transmission. The repo rate  was raised to combat inflation and maintain market stability, and has been kept on hold at 8 percent  between January 2014 and January 2015, supported by open market operations to sterilize FX  intervention. The RBI also took steps to enhance monetary transmission by lowering the cap on bank  access to its overnight liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), shifting liquidity injection toward term repos, and  paring back sector-specific liquidity facilities4. More recently, the RBI reduced the policy repo rate by 25  basis points (January 2015), reflecting disinflationary impulses.

High inflation has been a key source of vulnerability, discouraging financial saving,  eroding external competitiveness and exacerbating external imbalances, as well as spurring inequality  
4 The recalibration of the liquidity facilities, while primarily aimed at reducing banks’ passive dependence on the RBI for cash and treasury management to enhance monetary transmission, has resulted in an effective further slight tightening of the  monetary stance by raising the average cost of central bank liquidity to above the repo rate.

tight monetary policy stance will need to be accompanied by further structural reforms, which will boost  potential output and increase food production (see Selected Issues Chapter II).  
14. Continued progress is needed to further strengthen the monetary policy framework  and move towards flexible inflation targeting. The RBI has shifted policy formulation to focus on  containing inflation (with headline CPI inflation as a de-facto nominal anchor) and strengthened policy  communication, including through publication of two-year-ahead inflation forecasts and associated  confidence bands. Staff views the medium-term 4 percent inflation target set out by the Patel  Committee report as broadly appropriate. However, in view of India’s large weight on food in its CPI  basket and structurally-high food inflation, achieving this target will require ramping up food supply  commensurate with strong consumption demand. The associated band (+/- 2 percent) is appropriate  in light of India’s susceptibility to food supply and external shocks (see Selected Issues Chapter III). Staff supports further efforts to enhance the monetary framework along the lines set out in the Patel

Committee Report including: increasing the operational autonomy of the RBI; institutionalization and  setting the target zone for headline CPI inflation; and establishment of a Monetary Policy Committee  and accountability framework (see Selected Issues Chapter IV).  
Authorities’ Views  
15. The authorities noted that monetary policy needs to strike a balance between the  primary objective of reducing inflation and limiting the adverse impact on growth, while  preserving financial stability. The RBI recognized the effectiveness of supply-side measures to help  contain inflation, and noted that going forward, implementation of growth-friendly fiscal  consolidation and additional supply-side measures would constitute pre-conditions for monetary  easing. They also noted that upside risks to inflation remain, including from spikes in oil prices, price  pressures from input costs, deficient rainfall, as well as from ongoing excess demand for protein-rich  food items.  
16. The authorities emphasized that India has not yet adopted a flexible inflation targeting  regime. They consider the current regime to be a transitional one, and noted that discussions are  on-going between the RBI and the government on the final contours of the new monetary policy  framework, as indicated by the Finance Minister in the Budget speech on the need for a stronger  monetary policy framework. In the meantime, the RBI has indicated a CPI inflation “glide path” to the  achievement of a medium-term target for CPI inflation of 4 percent (+/- 2 percentage points).  
B. Consolidating the Fiscal Position  
17. Fiscal consolidation has continued, in line with the government’s deficit reduction path.  The authorities have demonstrated their commitment to consolidation, in particular in light of the  negative output gap, leading to pro-cyclical fiscal tightening to restore fiscal space. The 2013/14  fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP (authorities’ definition) over-performed relative to the  government’s target of 4.7 percent of GDP, and the primary deficit has narrowed by 2 percentage  points of GDP since 2010/11. However, this consolidation was achieved largely as a result of cuts in  capital spending. The 2014/15 Budget targets a central government deficit of 4.1 percent of GDP  (authorities’ definition, equivalent to about 4½ percent of GDP in IMF terms). Despite sluggish  revenues and delayed disinvestment, this year’s deficit target is expected to be achieved in part due  to further expenditure compression. Nonetheless, declining global oil prices, in conjunction with the  recent diesel-price deregulation and capping of LPG subsidies, are expected to help lower the fuel  subsidy bill. To help meet the 2014/15 deficit target, energy excise duties were increased and non plan expenditure was restrained.  
18. Looking forward, medium-term fiscal targets appear to be challenging. The medium term consolidation path aims for the central government deficit to narrow further to 3 percent of  GDP by 2016/17, but detailed measures underpinning this path have not yet been articulated.8 Achieving the 3 percent target for 2016/17 will require a comprehensive set of measures.  
8 As a result, staff’s medium-term fiscal projections, which are on the basis of current policies and assume no major  legislative changes, forecast less fiscal adjustment. 
10 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 
Overhauling the subsidy regime to contain leakages in food subsidies and further reducing  petroleum and fertilizer subsidies is estimated to yield around ½ of one percent of GDP in fiscal  savings. Given the narrowness of current Indian tax bases, further revenue gains can be achieved by  instituting tax administration reforms, including by reorganizing tax administration along functional  lines, by merging indirect and direct tax boards. Such measures on the revenue and expenditure side  should be undertaken, in order to increase growth-enhancing capital spending, while continuing on  an overall fiscal consolidation path.  
19. While the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation is welcome, the quality of  consolidation should be improved to be more growth enhancing. Significant tax reforms and  further rationalization of subsidies will be required to create the fiscal space for higher growth enhancing capital spending and social expenditures. Specifically, staff recommends the following  
measures:  
· Tax reform. India’s revenue-to-GDP ratio is  30 
considerably below its peers. A well-designed goods  25 
and service tax (GST) should be implemented, with  20 
minimal exemptions and a moderate single rate, as it  15 
would create a single Indian market, enhance the  10 
efficiency of internal movement of goods and services,  5 
and thereby boost GDP growth (see Box 4). Progress  0 
towards a revised direct tax code, with smaller and  streamlined deductions, would also help. Efforts to  improve tax administration, including along the lines

outlined in the Tax Administration Reform Commission (TARC) reports, should continue.

namely direct benefit transfers, increased financial  
inclusion, and use of the Aadhaar system to better target beneficiaries, should yield large savings.  The forthcoming recommendations of the Expenditure Management Commission should also be  helpful in identifying additional savings.  
9 The Food Security Act (2013)—which will provide subsidized rice, wheat and coarse cereals to 67 percent of the  Indian population—is not expected to add significantly to the 2014/15 fiscal subsidy burden, as it has been  implemented in only eleven of the Indian states and union territories thus far.  
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11 
INDIA  
· Fiscal responsibility legislation. The government’s medium-term consolidation path should be  underpinned by a strengthened Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. In particular, the  design of future fiscal responsibility legislation could be enhanced by using a rule that provides room  for countercyclical fiscal policy—such as capping nominal expenditure growth in addition to a deficit  rule with built-in flexibility (see Selected Issues Chapter V).  
Unless such comprehensive fiscal measures are instituted, fiscal adjustment will likely be met through  expenditure compression (including lower capital spending) or an underfunding of important social  programs, as has occurred in recent years, which will undermine efforts to enhance economic growth  and inclusiveness. In contrast, success in achieving the authorities’ medium-term fiscal goals would  support business confidence, reinforce the efforts of the RBI’s tight monetary stance in fighting  inflation, lower public sector financing costs, and reduce overall fiscal vulnerabilities.  
20. India’s public debt is projected to decline over the medium term and remains on a  sustainable path. India’s relatively high nominal GDP growth means that public debt (with a  favorable maturity structure, currency composition as well as a captive domestic investor base)  remains on a downward path and is sustainable (see debt sustainability analysis (DSA) of Annex II).  Under the baseline, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to decline gradually to about 58½  percent over the medium term from its current level of 65½ percent. While the baseline scenario  already uses conservative growth assumptions, large negative growth shocks represent one of the  major risks to the declining debt trajectory.  
Authorities’ Views  
21. Staff and the authorities broadly share a common outlook on the path for fiscal  consolidation, with the authorities noting that they are sticking with fiscal adjustment in the  midst of an economic slowdown. Fiscal adjustment in 2014/15 is likely to be accomplished through  expenditure compression, but the authorities do not expect a repeat of previous years’ sharp  reduction in capital spending. Noting recent IMF research suggesting that infrastructure spending  can be sufficiently growth-enhancing to offset some of the direct cost incurred, they emphasize that  they are making a strong effort to preserve the investment budget, carving out fiscal space for it by  reducing lower-priority capital spending items. The authorities pointed out that in August 2014 they  liberalized the project appraisal and approval process in line Ministries, which should accelerate the  pace of public investment approvals, and introduced zero-based budgetary principles to better  prioritize planned spending. The authorities also noted that the Expenditure Management  Commission is expected to propose a number of rationalization measures on the recurrent spending  side, such as a transition to direct benefit transfers, including by linking them to the unique  identification number (Aadhaar) system. Even if capital spending at the central government level, in  the end, faces some reduction to meet the overall deficit target, the authorities are confident that  capital spending at the state level will remain healthy, ensuring that—at the general government  level—compression of capital spending would be kept to a minimum. 
22. The authorities concurred with staff that enhanced revenue mobilization is a priority  over the medium term. Once implemented, they expect that the GST will gradually boost revenue  indirectly not only by promoting faster economic growth, but also by helping move economic

INDIA 
activity to the formal sector, thereby expanding the tax base and improving compliance. The  authorities noted staff’s proposal on enhancing fiscal responsibility, and considered that, perhaps in  the context of discussions surrounding a renewed fiscal rule, some flexibility regarding the fiscal  deficit target could be introduced. The authorities disagreed with staff on the desirability of merging  direct and indirect tax boards, arguing that functional specialization remains necessary.  
C. Maintaining External Stability  
23. India’s external position is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and  desirable policy settings, while reserves are assessed to be adequate (Box 5). International reserves  have increased by about $30 billion over the last year to reach US$320 billion as at end-December 2014  
(standing at 148 percent of the Fund’s reserve  adequacy metric). In addition, the RBI has intervened  100

concessional foreign exchange (FX) swap facility offered by the RBI.10 Based on a range of methodologies,  staff assesses the external position to be broadly in line with fundamentals (see Box 6 and Selected Issues  Chapter VI).  
24. The foreign exchange intervention strategy of the RBI (in both spot and forward markets)  is guided by the need to enhance growth, reduce inflation, limit volatility, and build buffers for  precautionary purposes. The RBI’s forward FX purchases have helped it cover forward FX liabilities and  
maintain tight monetary conditions to contain inflation.  Reflecting this forward intervention and the interest  2.0

25. If global financial market volatility resurfaces, a comprehensive and well-communicated  set of policies will be needed. In this event, staff would recommend exchange rate flexibility (as a key  shock absorber), allowing for an orderly depreciation of the rupee, with judicious FX intervention (both in  
the spot and forward markets, and via liquidity provision  through swaps) to minimize disruptive movements in the  16 
currency. Also, to make it more costly to short the rupee,

measures used successfully by India during the post-May  
2013 period—including offering FX swaps to banks to attract NRI deposits and providing dollar liquidity to  oil-marketing companies to limit depreciation—could be used again in the event of the re-emergence of  external pressures (see Selected Issues Chapter VII for an analysis of Indian and EM responses to recent  bouts of global financial market volatility).11 The RBI should also further explore options to increase the  availability of bilateral and multilateral swap lines. 12 
FDI Inflows, 2013 
26. The current account deficit financing mix  6 
could be improved by enhancing the environment  5 
for attracting stable, non-debt creating capital  4 
flows, particularly FDI. India’s financial account has  3 
traditionally been dominated by portfolio equity and  2 
FDI flows. However, the composition of CAD financing  1 
has recently shifted toward more debt flows,  0 
particularly in the form of NRI deposits and external  commercial borrowing (including by highly-leveraged  Indian corporates and those with unhedged FX

exposures). Given that portfolio debt flows have been volatile in recent years and the exchange rate  has been sensitive to these flows and changes in global risk aversion, attracting more stable sources  of financing would reduce vulnerabilities. A conducive business environment is necessary to attract  more FDI, along with further liberalization of FDI in specific sectors and simplification of procedures.  
11 The RBI introduced two foreign exchange swap schemes in September 2013—one to encourage new foreign  exchange deposits into India by non-resident Indians (NRI) with a minimum term of three years; and one to encourage long-term overseas foreign exchange borrowing by banks. Under both swap schemes, the RBI agreed to sell to banks on a forward basis and until November 30, 2013, U.S. dollars against rupees at concessional rates, which gives rise to multiple currency practices (MCP) relating solely to capital transactions. These MCPs are not subject to Fund approval because the Fund has declined to assert jurisdiction over MCPs relating solely to capital transactions (see BUFF/85/34). 
12 India has a swap line with the Bank of Japan of US$50 billion, and the BRICS’ Contingency Reserve Arrangement will  enable India to draw US$6 billion (and another US$12 billion with a Fund program).

INDIA 
In addition to having permitted FDI in railways, infrastructure and defense sectors, going forward,  higher FDI limits in sectors such as construction and insurance could lead to increased FDI flows.  Nonetheless, further liberalization of external commercial borrowing should proceed cautiously and  be carefully monitored by the RBI, given the potential risks to corporate balance sheets.13  
Authorities’ Views  
27. The authorities noted that while India’s external vulnerabilities are reduced, they  intend to further rebuild their external buffers. The authorities are somewhat concerned about  the risks of disorderly monetary policy normalization in advanced countries, as well as loss of export  competitiveness due to prolonged use of unconventional monetary policies by advanced countries.  They welcomed IMF staff analysis showing that India and other EMs have been affected by  unconventional monetary policies of advanced economies, and noted that despite building greater  resilience to external shocks, they would likely be adversely affected by a disorderly reversal of such  policies in the future. The authorities reiterated that they are not targeting any specific level of the  rupee exchange rate, and attributed foreign exchange purchases over the past year to a desire to  rebuild their external buffers. They acknowledge some tension between their foreign exchange  intervention and the focus on reducing inflation, and regard the financial market distortions from  their intervention policy as minimal. They noted that significant progress has been made in creating  a conducive business environment to attract foreign direct investment flows.

Also,  restructured loans (as a share of total advances) increased slightly from 5.8 to 5.9 percent of total  advances over the last fiscal year.14 Nonetheless, concerns over evergreening remain, as more than  90 percent of those sales of NPAs to ARCs were financed by banks via issuance of security receipts.  
29. Corporate vulnerability indicators show signs of stabilization but remain elevated.  Although the share of debt held by firms with an interest coverage ratio below one fell by    
13 To encourage foreign-currency-risk-free borrowings for corporates under the external commercial borrowing (ECB)  facility, since September 2014 the RBI has permitted recognized non-resident ECB lenders to extend loans in Indian  rupees, funded through swaps undertaken with an eligible bank in India.  
14 The RBI’s December 2014 Financial Stability Report shows an increase in gross NPAs across all scheduled  commercial banks to 4.5 percent of gross advances, with stressed assets (the sum of gross NPAs and restructured  assets) increasing by 0.7 percent to 10.7 percent between March and September 2014 for all scheduled commercial  banks, and by 1 percent for PSBs, reaching 12.9 percent over the same period.

2.5 percent to 13.8 percent during 2013/14, the shares of loss-making companies and those with a  leverage ratio above two have increased slightly to 22.9 and 31.4 percent, respectively (see Selected  Issues Chapters VIII and IX).15 As noted in the RBI’s 2013/14 Annual Report, sectors subject to greater  stress—infrastructure, textiles, engineering, metals and products, chemicals, and mining—make up  36 percent of NPAs as of March 2014. Also, as noted in a recent speech by the RBI’s Deputy  Governor, based on the indicative data, the hedge ratio for external commercial borrowings and  foreign currency convertible bonds (excluding natural hedges) declined sharply from about  34 percent of borrowings in 2013/14 to about 15 percent in July–August 2014.16 
30. Weaknesses have been more pronounced in public sector banks, which represent three quarters of banking system assets. These challenges include larger capital needs and weaker asset  quality, which stem in part from large exposure to infrastructure in the last few years. The profitability of  PSBs remains weak, due to lower operating efficiency. Nonetheless, new capital injections for India’s  banks (to meet Basel III requirements and additional capital requirements due to restructured loans being  reclassified as NPAs) are likely to be moderate (see Box 8). A multi-pronged approach is needed to  remedy long-standing structural issues in the PSBs, including weak corporate governance. Such an  approach should entail further disinvestment by the government, while improving corporate governance  and human resource policies, consistent with key recommendations of the Nayak Committee report. 17 Staff welcomes the government’s intention to reduce its shareholdings in PSBs down to 52 percent  and thereby allow the public banks to strengthen their equity capital base.  
31. The RBI has made further progress in financial sector reforms since the 2014 Article IV  consultation. Efforts have focused on strengthening regulation, including important progress on  implementing Basel III, identifying Domestic Systemically Important Banks and imposing capital  surcharges on them, improving the resolution of impaired assets, and expanding access to finance.  
· The RBI has recently tightened prudential regulations, including requiring ARCs to provide at  least 15 percent equity towards purchases of NPAs, while phasing out (by April 1, 2015) the  ability for many types of loans to be categorized as rescheduled (and thereby face lower  provisioning requirements).  
· In addition, from July 2014, the RBI has allowed the move of infrastructure and coal sector loans  into five-year term loans with the ability of rollover, which improves the asset-liability structure of  banks. Going forward, the health of the Indian banking system would be best served by ending  the forbearance provided by the current restructuring mechanism for all types of loans.

16 The speech is available at http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=919. In April 2014, the RBI  introduced incremental provisioning and capital requirements for banks’ exposures to entities with unhedged foreign  exchange exposures.  
17 In order to improve governance, the government intends to separate the positions of CEO and chairman at PSBs (in  line with the Nayak Committee’s recommendations), except for State Bank of India (SBI). The government also intends  to revise the appointment process for membership of PSBs’ boards.

· The RBI has taken steps to remove information asymmetries and enable banks to improve credit  risk management through the establishment of a large borrower database (beginning May 2014).  
· The RBI intends to subject RBI-regulated non-bank financial corporations (NBFCs) to more  stringent regulatory norms (in line with those for banks), which will help strengthen the stability  of this fast-growing part of the financial sector.18 Although NBFCs’ asset growth has significantly  outpaced bank asset growth since 2011, their assets correspond to only about 13 percent of  bank assets. NBFCs are generally well regulated, with the largest 480 NBFCs (representing around  90 percent of total NBFC assets) subject to RBI regulation and supervision.19 
32. Over the past year, a number of measures were enacted which improved corporate  governance, enhanced the securities market regulator’s (SEBI) enforcement powers, and increased  transparency of participatory notes (P-Notes). Measures expanding the rights of minority investors  helped improve India’s standing in the World Bank’s “Protecting Minority Investors rank” from about 30th in 2013 to 7th as at June 2014. A recent amendment to the SEBI Act equipped the regulator with powers  of search and seizure; in cases crossing state lines, recourse is now available to a single court in Mumbai,  rather than to civil courts in all involved states. Foreign investors’ ownership of P-Notes was streamlined  by restricting the types of investors who can own such notes.20 Also, brokers which sell P-Notes now  have to provide SEBI with the names of their beneficiaries. India is currently re-negotiating the  double-taxation treaties with several countries, partly in  
order to rationalize such investments, and as a follow on  to measures enacted in 2014 to ease the registration

33. Enhancing financial inclusion has been a key  priority for the government.21 The RBI has issued  guidelines to set up differentiated banks (such as payments

18 This includes the largest NBFCs, deposits-taking NBFCs, or those involved in leasing, lending, or securities  investments. The RBI decided to: (i) increase capital minimum requirements from Rs 2.5 million to Rs 20 million (by  March 2017); (ii) require asset finance companies to receive ratings (by March 2016); (iii) require NBFCs with assets  above Rs 5 billion, and all deposit-taking NBFCs to maintain a minimum Tier-1 capital ratio of 10 percent (by March  2017); and require systemically important and deposit-taking NBFCs to provision more (in line with banks). Most of  the new requirements will be phased in over time.  
19 However, government-owned NBFCs are not subject to full RBI supervision.  
20 P-Notes are a type of derivative instrument which foreign investors can buy through an entity registered in a country with  which India has a double taxation agreement (usually Mauritius, Cyprus, or Singapore), relieving them from the need to  register with SEBI or pay Indian capital gains taxes, and have provided anonymity to such investors.  
21 Indian banks are subject to sectoral lending requirements (priority sectors include agriculture, SMEs), but these are  undertaken primarily on a commercial basis, and lead to higher credit offtake and higher growth. Staff analysis finds  that enhanced financial inclusion and access to finance leads to higher economic output and lower inequality (see  Selected Issues Chapter X).  
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17 
INDIA  
banks) which focus more narrowly on the provision of basic financial services, using new technologies,  while investing only in relatively safe assets such as government securities. Two new banking licenses  were allocated in April 2014, with the provision that at least 25 percent of new branches have to be in  rural areas. The government has launched an ambitious scheme (Jan Dhan Yojana) to provide bank  accounts for each poor Indian family. Each account would include a debit card, accident and life insurance  coverage, and an overdraft facility (to motivate active use of the accounts).  
34. To maintain financial stability and enhance the ability of the financial sector to contribute  to growth, staff supports the following measures:  
· The RBI should further strengthen regulation for banks’ credit quality classification and require  increased provisioning (particularly for all types of restructured assets under the Corporate Debt  Restructuring framework) to strengthen financial stability.22 Furthermore, bolstering capital  buffers in public sector banks remains essential to ensure the banking sector’s ability to support  the recovery, while allowing the PSBs to meet their Basel III obligations.  
· Given the increased unhedged FX exposures of large corporates, strengthened monitoring of the  extent of corporate vulnerabilities is warranted.  
· Staff continues to endorse the 2012 FSAP’s recommendation to reduce group exposure limits in  line with international norms.  
· The RBI should continue its focus on improving debt recovery by banks, including by providing  incentives to swiftly deal with delinquent borrowers (including through enhancing supervision)  and promoters. Efforts are needed to improve the insolvency legal and institutional framework,  particularly on the implementation side of the Companies Act 2013. This includes building a  
larger corps of specialized judges and a cadre of insolvency and workout experts in the private  sector, to facilitate faster insolvency resolution  
· Steps to update India’s regulatory architecture, drawing upon the recommendations by the  Financial Sector Legislative Reform Commission (FSLRC) and those in consonance with global  regulatory reform, should continue.23  
· The Statutory Liquidity Requirement should continue to be reduced as the fiscal deficit declines,  which will free up resources for lending to the private sector.  
· Measures to enhance the corporate bond market should be taken, by improving liquidity in the  secondary market and developing a robust bond holder protection mechanism.  
· The emphasis on financial inclusion could also be facilitated by new technologies (for example,  Aadhaar-based KYC compliance and Aadhaar-supported direct benefit transfers), including by  utilizing mobile phone payments technology.  
22 The RBI’s December 2014 Financial Stability Report finds that provisions would not be able to cover expected losses  from credit risk under certain adverse macroeconomic conditions (based on an analysis of the 60 largest banks).  
23 To revamp financial sector laws, the government set up the FSLRC in March 2011. The Commission in its report has  given wide-ranging recommendations, both legislative and nonlegislative, on the institutional, legal, and regulatory  framework and operational changes in the Indian financial sector. The draft Indian Financial Code has been proposed  and includes provisions that aim at replacing existing financial laws.

INDIA 
Authorities’ Views  
35. The authorities emphasized the strong actions taken over the past year to strengthen  the regime for tackling stressed assets. They noted that they are balancing the need to instill  greater payment discipline in borrowers against the challenges faced by banks and infrastructure  firms that are over-leveraged, in some cases due to lack of government action to clear projects in a  timely manner. The authorities have created a database of large borrowers and placed pressure on  “willful defaulters.” At the same time, they recognized the challenges inherent in the ARC mechanism,  and an effort is underway to reform the bankruptcy and insolvency framework.  
36. The authorities view the slowdown in private sector credit growth as primarily due to  weak demand for bank loans, rather than impaired balance sheets of banks. In their view, the  build-up of excess capacity in some sectors during the boom years means that the current recovery  could continue with sluggish credit growth. In addition, they noted that oil marketing companies’  demand for bank credit has fallen in light of much-reduced oil prices. Furthermore, some corporates  are shifting to non-bank financing sources, reflecting in part their lower funding costs. On the supply  side, lenders are now more cautious than previously, given the RBI’s efforts to rein in bad lending  practices, but banks—including the public sector banks—remain well capitalized and liquid.  
E. Structural Policies to Boost Growth and Employment  
37. Addressing long-standing supply bottlenecks, especially in the energy, mining and power  sectors, as well as labor and product market reforms, are crucial to achieving faster growth and  job creation. The strong mandate given to the government in May 2014 provides an opportunity to  continue to unlock the productive potential of the country. Key reforms, including those to factor markets  (land, labor, natural resources), are: 
· Reforms to the power sector and rationalizing natural resource allocation. Addressing structural  challenges in the power sector and natural resource allocation (in particular allowing further  private sector participation in coal mining, including for commercial mining) and pricing are  critical to boosting investment and potential growth.24  
· Easing land acquisition. As part of ongoing efforts to enhance the pace of land clearances, in  December 2014 the government approved an ordinance to simplify and clarify the process of  acquiring land under the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act 2013.  
· Strengthening the business climate. Ongoing efforts to streamline and expedite land and  environmental clearances should continue, as should simplification of procedures to improve  India’s business climate. The authorities’ efforts to improve India’s ranking on the World Bank’s  Doing Business indicators are welcome, particularly in the underperforming areas of resolving  insolvency, enforcing contracts, and trade across borders. Adopting the recommendations of the  Tax Administration Reform Commission would do much to improve the business climate.  
24 The government has recently (December 2014) initiated deregulation of the coal industry (through the Coal Mines  Ordinance) by opening commercial mining to private sector participation, and raised administered natural gas prices  (which should incentivize natural gas production). 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19 
INDIA  
· Improving labor market flexibility. Recent steps by some states (for example, Rajasthan) to  increase labor market flexibility are welcome and should be complemented by further reforms at  the national level. Such reforms are key to increasing employment in the formal sector,  broadening the manufacturing base, and harnessing India’s demographic dividend. More flexible  labor markets would boost female labor force participation, which has been falling in recent  years (see Selected Issues Chapters XI and XII on India’s progress in meeting the Millennium  Development Goals and employment of women).25  
· Reorienting expenditure towards growth enhancing and social spending. Structural fiscal reforms  (including tax and subsidy reforms) will create the fiscal space for expenditure on health and  education, as well as on much-needed public infrastructure.  
· Agricultural reforms. Reforms in agriculture, in particular to reduce inefficiencies in the public  system for food procurement, distribution and storage, as well as lessen impediments to inter state movement of agricultural produce, should be instituted. Factors hampering agricultural  productivity, including inadequate irrigation infrastructure, should be addressed. 
Authorities’ Views 
38. There is broad agreement that structural reforms will be needed to achieve higher  potential growth. The authorities noted that efforts to improve the business climate have gathered  new momentum under the current government. The Prime Minister has set the target of dramatically  improving India’s ranking in the World Bank’s Doing Business survey, and a “Make in India”  campaign has been launched to attract investment. They emphasized steps being taken, both at the  center and in the states, to ease labor market restrictions, and pointed to plans for a simplification of  the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act.  
STAFF APPRAISAL  
39. Policy actions have reduced external vulnerabilities, though risks remain. India was hit hard  by global liquidity tightening during the post-May 22, 2013 taper tantrum period. In response, the  authorities’ implemented wide-ranging policies to contain market volatility, accelerate project approvals,  correct imbalances and build buffers against external shocks. While India’s underlying vulnerabilities have  receded, there remains little room for countercyclical macroeconomic policies to respond to domestic and  external shocks.  
40. India’s economic outlook has improved. The near-term growth outlook is favorable, helped by  greater political certainty, several policy actions, improved business confidence, and reduced external  vulnerabilities. Growth appears to have bottomed out and is expected to strengthen gradually as a result  of the revival in industrial and investment activity, and steps taken to alleviate supply-side  bottlenecks. India’s persistently-high inflation has moderated recently, due to favorable base effects,  a tight monetary stance, lower global commodity prices, and government efforts to contain food

20 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 
inflation. Nonetheless, inflation remains a key concern given its ingrained nature and elevated  inflation expectations. Tight fiscal and monetary policies are needed to continue to narrow  macroeconomic imbalances.  
41. Notwithstanding brighter economic prospects, downside risks remain. On the external  side, despite the strengthening of buffers and reduced vulnerabilities, spillovers from weak global  growth and global financial market volatility could be very disruptive, including from any unexpected  developments in the course of U.S. monetary policy normalization. Domestic risks include  heightened weaknesses in corporate balance sheets and worsening bank asset quality, as well as  slower-than-expected progress in addressing supply-side bottlenecks, which could weigh on growth.  On the upside, expedited structural reforms and faster implementation of cleared investment  projects could lead to stronger growth, as would a further decline in global energy prices.  
42. Monetary policy needs to remain tight to consolidate recent gains in reducing inflation. In the absence of supply-side measures to raise potential output and constrain food price inflation,  maintaining a tight monetary stance is needed to durably bring down inflation and achieve the RBI’s  6 percent CPI inflation objective by 2016. To lower inflation durably over the medium term, a tight  monetary policy stance will need to be accompanied by further structural reforms. Continued progress is  needed to further strengthen the monetary policy framework and move towards flexible inflation  targeting.  
43. While continuing fiscal consolidation is welcome, the quality of fiscal adjustment  should be improved. Recent fiscal consolidation has been achieved largely as a result of cuts in  capital spending, while tax revenues have stagnated. The October 2014 diesel-price deregulation and  capping of LPG subsidies are welcome and are expected to help lower the fuel subsidy bill. The  medium-term fiscal targets are broadly appropriate, but appear challenging in the absence of clearly  articulated measures that would underpin the targeted fiscal adjustment. Significant tax reforms  (including through introduction of the GST and better tax administration) and rationalizing subsidies  (including through further reductions in fuel and fertilizer subsidies and untargeted food subsidies)  will be required to create the fiscal space for higher growth-enhancing capital spending and social  expenditures.  
44. The external position is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals, while  reserves are assessed to be adequate. Given India’s increased and adequate reserve buffers, greater  exchange rate flexibility would be welcome and thereby encourage private sector entities to limit  excessive risk taking. Foreign exchange intervention should be limited to preventing disruptive  movements in the exchange rate. If global financial market volatility resurfaces, exchange rate flexibility  should be an important shock absorber. The current account deficit financing mix could be improved  by enhancing the environment for attracting stable, non-debt creating capital flows, particularly FDI.  Further liberalization of external commercial borrowing should proceed cautiously, given the  potential vulnerabilities of corporate balance sheets. 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21 
INDIA  
45. While the Indian banking system is well capitalized, slow growth and heightened corporate  vulnerabilities have led to a deterioration in bank asset quality. The RBI should further strengthen  regulation for banks’ credit quality classification, require increased provisioning, continue to monitor  corporates’ FX unhedged exposures, and reduce group exposure limits in line with international  norms to bolster financial stability. Furthermore, augmenting capital buffers in public sector banks  remains essential to ensure the banking sector’s ability to provide adequate credit to support the  recovery, while allowing public banks to meet Basel III capital requirements. Over the medium term,  the authorities should implement their plan to reduce the public shareholding in public sector banks  to 52 percent, and improve corporate governance at public banks.  
46. Reforms to labor and product markets, as well as alleviating long-standing supply  bottlenecks, are crucial to achieving faster, more inclusive growth. Tackling structural challenges in  the power sector and natural resource allocation and pricing, are critical to boosting investment and  potential growth. Ongoing efforts to streamline and expedite land and environmental clearances  should continue, as should simplification of procedures to improve India’s business climate. Further  reforms to increase labor market flexibility are key to increasing employment in the formal sector  and broadening India’s manufacturing base.  
47. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month  cycle.

RBI introduced a framework for revitalizing distressed assets with guidelines for refinancing of project loans, sale of NPAs and other measures, and issued guidelines for flexible restructuring/refinancing long-term project loans and take-out  financing under 5/25 rule against existing and fresh loans to infrastructure and core industry projects. RBI issued new  guidelines against “non-cooperative borrowers”, defined as willful defaulters with loan amounts of Rs 50 million or more. 
Set up four Task Forces to assist the government in preparing the roadmap for the establishment of new agencies as per  the recommendations of FSLRC committee report. Government allowed Public Sector Banks (PSBs) to raise capital to  meet their additional capital requirements under Basel III (due by 2019) by diluting the government’s shareholding in  PSBs to 52 percent in a phased manner (issued December 2014). 
Monetary Policy
RBI accepted Patel Committee recommendations to anchor CPI headline inflation with a ""glide path"" for achieving 8 percent CPI headline inflation by January 2015 and 6 percent by January 2016. RBI shifted to a bi-monthly cycle of  monetary policy review and provided one-year-ahead inflation forecasts. Government supportive of formal adoption of a  new monetary policy framework for flexible inflation targeting.

database."" Banks are supposed to provide information on  corporates whose total exposure exceeds Rs 50 million  (including ECBs extended by Indian overseas bank offices and  branches). This database is up and running now, albeit data  quality and operational issues have to be ironed out before  the data can be fully relied upon. The data will inform the RBI  about corporate exposures, but will be also shared with the  banks. It is intended for the system to later be merged with  the information compiled about FX-exposures. Since  December 2013, banks also have to report accounts past due  between 61-90 days, and have to set up a joint lenders’  committee for those with exposures in excess of Rs 1 billion.  
Further reduction of vulnerabilities and risks. A law is  being drafted to remove members of boards of public banks  who are related to supervisory agencies.  
The Nayak Committee published its report on the governance  of banks in May 2014, recommending significant changes to  governance in public sector banks (PSBs). The authorities  stated that they are closely looking at the report's  recommendations, with an eye to implementing a number of  those. The announced intention of the Government of India  to reduce its shareholdings in PSBs to 52 percent will be  supportive in that process.  
The mission was informed that some of the public financial  institutions are non-bank financial corporations (NBFCs),  which are not subject to RBI oversight. RBI has recommended  that they be made subject to RBI oversight. No change in the  law is needed for that.  
It should be noted that the FSLRC will restructure India's  financial supervisory system completely, likely leading to  greater centralization.

Continue to strengthen coordination and information  sharing mechanisms among domestic supervisors via  MOUs and formal frameworks. (¶49, 67)  
Additional risk reduction. Additional MOUs are being  negotiated and signed. RBI has hosted supervisory colleges  for Indian banks with a major international presence.  Overseas offices of five large Indian banks representing 86  percent of total overseas assets have been inspected so far. 
Additional risk reduction. See point 2 above (“Further  reduction of vulnerabilities and risks”).  
The RBI notes that it currently cannot revoke the license of a  PSB, since they are organized as state-owned enterprises,  outside the Companies' Act. The RBI is asking the government  to change that. This would necessitate a change in the  relevant legislation. 
No additional risk reduction. The authorities are committed  to bring India in line with the 'Final Standard' for connected  counterparties (disseminated by the Basel Committee for  Banking Supervision in April 2014) by January 2019. However,  they noted that India's current limits, which are above the  international norms, are needed in order to facilitate financing  particularly for infrastructure purposes. The RBI will soon issue  a discussion paper on this subject.  
Some risk reduction is taking place. The RBI's human  resources department is working on setting up a new  certification system for supervisors. Also, a more structured  and quantitative approach is being employed, based on a  more intensive use of models. The U.S. Federal Reserve's  approach to the accreditation of bank-internal credit models  is being used. New training programs are being devised in  cooperation with the World Bank's Financial Sector  Development Program, as well as collaborative programs with  other external agencies.  
A particular challenge exists with regards to the training of  NBFC supervisors, because of the variety of business models  and issues that prevail in that area.  
Further reduction in risk. A Financial Stability and  Development Council (FSDC) has been set up to strengthen  financial stability, financial sector development, and inter regulatory coordination. A subcommittee headed by the RBI  Governor was also set up, with same membership as FSDC.  An inter-regulatory committee to help the banking sector to  comply with Basel III norms was set up in March 2014, with a  number of working groups focused on issues of financial  inclusion, monitoring of financial conglomerates, and other  issues. The inter-regulatory committee has initiated work on a  repository which will capture all accounts of an individual or  other entity.  
Regulators are also working across agencies on specific issues  and companies, when they span the purview of several  agencies. A MOU between the RBI, SEBI, and other agencies  was signed to facilitate the supervision of conglomerate  entities. The RBI was also enabled to receive information  directly from entities associated with banks.  
The supervision of commodities exchanges was shifted to the  Ministry of Finance from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in  order to make supervision more comprehensive, and avoid  regulatory arbitrage (2013).

Significant risk reduction. The new Pension Law (PFRDA)  was passed.  
Some changes. The authorities want to keep the SLR as a  monetary tool. Five percentage points of the SLR can be used  for repo with the RBI for up to 30 days, representing high  quality liquid assets; an additional two percentage points can  be used to access the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF).  
Some risk reduction. Work on this is in the planning stage. An internal working group had produced a plan on the  resolution regime for financial institutions, while a task force  under the FSLRC has been set up to work on an interagency  basis. The RBI Governor has made this issue a priority.  Vulnerabilities therefore still persist.  
The working group on resolution has also made  recommendations for the resolution of NBFCs. 
Some risk reduction. Work on this, both at the level of the  Ministry of Finance and the RBI, is progressing. A crisis  management group has been set up inside the RBI, while the  inter-regulatory committee of the FSDC has set up an early  warning group. Crisis arrangements for the payments system  have been tested.  
A core settlement guarantee fund was set up at the Clearing  Corporation of India (CCIL); SEBI also issued more granular  norms for stress testing and the harmonization of default  waterfalls across clearing corporations.  
Additional measures implemented. Taxes on FX-bonded  debt were reduced; three types of investment limits for  foreign investors were consolidated into one limit of $51  billion; and new infrastructure investment schemes were  implemented, one focused on foreigners. The one-year lock in period for foreigners was removed.  New guidelines were issued for insurers and pension funds,  which should increase their participation in those markets.  Corporate and infrastructure bonds can be used as collateral  in repo with banks.  
Bonds issued for purposes of infrastructure financing are  exempt from CRR and can be deducted from SLR  requirements. Pension funds can now invest now in corporate  and infrastructure bonds with a minimum rating of AA. In  addition to a number of other measures providing greater  flexibility for institutional investors when investing and  trading bonds, mutual funds can now also use AA-rated  corporate bonds in repo transactions. SEBI has also provided  guidelines for the trading of bonds on stock exchanges.

Box 2. Balance-Sheet Analysis (BSA) of the Indian Economy1 
The balance-sheet matrix depicts gross asset and liability positions of different sectors of the  Indian economy, and is used to assess risks and cross-sector spillovers. The BSA for India is based  on the flow of funds data as published by the Reserve Bank of India—consisting of 2011/12 data on  the sources and uses of funds of the following sectors: (i) Banking, (ii) Other Financial Institutions, (iii)  Private Corporate Business, (iv) Government, (v) Rest of the World, and (vi) Households. Of these six  sectors, flows from the rest of the world constitute only 9 percent of total inter-sectoral financial flows  (indicating the relatively-closed nature of the Indian economy), while the banking sector and other  financial institutions form about 40 percent of total inter-sectoral financial flows (highlighting a mainly  bank-based financial system).  
The banking system is mostly exposed to the government (representing 50 percent of their  assets). This is primarily due to the fact that banks have been restricted by regulation in their use of  funds, including from reserve requirements as well as the regulation to invest a portion of their funds  in government securities and lend to “priority sectors”. Other financial institutions (OFIs) are of two  types: (i) term-lending institutions which obtain most of their funds from banks and intermediate  them to corporates; or (ii) insurance funds, public provident fund, or unit trusts that are mainly  financed by households (magnitudes of exposures are reflected in the Table below).  
The linkage between the financial and real sectors comes from households’ financial savings as  well as physical investment made by deficit sectors: private corporate sector and government. An important financial asset of the household’s portfolio is bank deposits, which is, in turn an  important source of funds for banks. Apart from statutory requirement in the use of funds, the two  assets where banks can actually exercise choice are: excess reserves and loans to corporates (affected  by monetary and fiscal policies as well as portfolio choice of saving households). The liabilities of  corporates amount to 30 percent of India’s total inter-sectoral financial borrowings as at end 2011/12,  and are mainly financed from the rest of the world sector (23 percent), the banking system (18  percent), or OFIs (15 percent). There has been a marked increase in leverage of the private non financial corporate sector since early 2000s, reflecting easy global and domestic financial conditions.  Corporates have resorted to market financing, including external borrowing (in the form of External  Commercial Borrowings and Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds), partly reflecting lower financial  savings by households (resulting from elevated inflation and inflation expectations, and higher gold  purchases), and higher government financing requirements.  
We identify the following risks and cross-sector spillover channels from our BSA. The main risk  is the weakness in corporate balance sheets (including a large exposure to rest of the world). Further  corporate stress could emerge from a surge in global financial market volatility (affecting one of the  main sources of funds for corporates), adding to banks’ non-performing assets (NPAs), raising capital  
concerns and reducing lending in the medium term. Further deterioration in banks’ asset quality,  especially in public banks, could constrain credit supply given the high share of government in banks’  portfolio of assets. Despite the fact that a captive domestic investor base mitigates the impact of any  real interest rate shocks, the share of government in the asset portfolio of banks is very high and  should be gradually reduced over time (alongside further fiscal consolidation).2

Box 3. Does Inflation Slow Long-Run Growth in India?1 
Is there a non-linear long-run relationship between consumer price index industrial workers  (CPI-IW) inflation and GDP growth in India? The inflation-growth trade-off and the role of monetary  policy in India have received renewed interest among policy makers and academics in recent years as  persistently-high inflation and weak growth have co-existed. The conventional view is that inflation at  low levels “greases the wheels” of the economy, while at high levels it negatively affects the economy’s  
allocative efficiency and growth. In other words,  
while the short-run Phillips Curve postulates that  25 
inflation tolerance could be associated with higher  20 
growth, persistently-high inflation, especially  
15

beyond a certain threshold, (by itself) could be a

relationship in a sample of 14 Indian states over the  -5 
-10 
period 1989–2013, and estimate the threshold level  -15 
of inflation beyond which growth is more severely  undermined.  
Real GDP Growth and Inflation in India (All States),  1989-2013 
-5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Inflation
A key finding is that there are significant negative long-run effects of persistently-elevated  inflation on growth in India, and a growth-inhibiting inflation threshold of 5.5 percent. Our  findings suggest that, on average, there is a negative long-run relationship between inflation and  growth in India. Statistically-significant inflation-growth threshold effects are found for states with  
persistently-elevated inflation rates of above 5.5 percent. Specifically: (i) at low enough levels of  inflation (below 3 percent) we do not observe any statistically-significant effects of inflation on output  growth; (ii) average growth is higher for those states and periods which experienced inflation below  5.5 percent; and (iii) when inflation is greater than 3 percent, we observe a negative and statistically significant effect of inflation on long-run growth (with this negative effect being larger when inflation is  above 5.5 percent).  
This suggests the need for the authorities to balance the short-term growth–inflation trade–off,  in light of the long-term negative effects on growth of persistently-high inflation. Inflation in  India is driven by both supply and demand-side factors (including the National Rural Employment  Guarantee Act, supply bottlenecks, food and energy price pressures, and elevated inflation  expectations). Nonetheless, inflation remains one of the most important problems facing India’s  economy. Therefore, the authorities (via supply-side reforms as well as monetary policy) should  strengthen their anti-inflation efforts in order to avoid any negative long-run effects of excessive  inflation on growth.

Box 4. Goods and Services Tax and Tax Administration in India1 
India’s government sector is under

29 
now well below EM peers. Moreover, revenue

25 
concern about the central government, which  
23 
21 
retains own revenue of only about 9 percent of  19 
GDP, after statutory transfers to India’s states.  17 
Against this backdrop, India is moving towards  15

Goods and services tax (GST). A well-functioning GST will enhance tax compliance, and over time, following  the creation of a single market, boost growth, perhaps by as much as 1–1½ percent of GDP (see NCAER  report: http://bit.ly/1rYbdCv). However in the near term, the GST may not add substantially to revenue, as it  would replace a number of central and state level indirect taxes. Further, the center is expected to guarantee  compensation—for a limited time—to states which lose revenue. The GST design being contemplated is also  fairly complex, with a dual administration arrangement that involves the tax authorities of both the center  and the states separately taxing a single transaction. Issues that will require further work include crediting  across interstate borders, settlement of revenue sharing, and building capacity in states to tax services.  
Revenue administration. There is also scope for garnering revenue through improved tax administration.  Despite a population of 1.2 billion, there are only about 40 million direct taxpayers, both corporate and  individual. A broader tax base and better compliance management could yield additional revenues. In 2013,  the Ministry of Finance established a high-level tax administration reform commission (TARC). The TARC  reports propose a thorough modernization of the revenue administration framework in India, to enhance  revenue performance, improve the business climate by simplifying procedures, and tilt the corporate culture  of India’s revenue administration toward customer service (http://bit.ly/1vpnVER). Key recommendations are:  
· Reorganization of revenue administration along functional lines—to promote better data sharing and a  comprehensive understanding of tax payers’ businesses—by merging the central boards of direct and  indirect taxes and customs  
· More sophisticated use of integrated data bases and information technology  
· Making the large taxpayer unit mandatory, instead of voluntary as at present  
· Changing some tax policies to capture better-off individuals, including in the currently untaxed rural  sector by taxing high income (over Rs 5 million, or about $83,000) farmers  
· Raising the quality of tax administration professionals through skill development  · Improved dispute resolution processes that are faster, less adversarial and more collaborative and  customer focused  
· Strengthening the tax policy function in the Ministry of Finance by creating a Tax Council, headed by the  Chief Economic Advisor.  
The reform of revenue administration in India would be a multi-year endeavor, but it should reduce fiscal  vulnerabilities by closing some of the revenue gap with EM peers.

Box 5. Assessing Reserve Adequacy in India1 
India’s international reserves have increased by $45 billion since September 2013 to reach $320 billion as at end-December 2014. The build-up of reserves is mainly driven by three factors. The first  is the sharp fall in India’s current account deficit (CAD)—the CAD narrowed to 1.7 percent of GDP in  2013/14, a 3 percentage point of GDP reduction from the previous year, and is projected to remain at  about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2014/15. Second is the inflow of about $34 billion of non-resident Indian  deposits and overseas borrowings by banks, facilitated by a concessional FX swap facility offered by  the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) following the U.S. quantitative easing taper tantrum of summer 2013.  The third factor is robust foreign institutional investor (FII) inflows—FIIs have made about $48 billion in  net purchases of Indian equities and debt between September 2013 and December 2014.  
Given that any sudden stops or reversal of capital inflows could expose India to significant risks,  holding an adequate level of international reserves is essential for the country to reduce its  vulnerability. India is susceptible to surges in global financial market volatility (which could be  triggered by monetary policy normalization in advanced economies) as well as commodity-price  shocks, and should hold reserves for precautionary purposes. However, there is little consensus in the  literature on what constitutes an adequate level of reserves from a precautionary perspective. This Box  analyses international reserves in India using the reserve optimizing model of Jeanne and Ranciere  (2011), and compares the findings with those of the IMF’s risk-weighted metric (2013).2 The results  show that India’s international reserve levels are adequate to cover a broad set of risks.  
The Reserve Optimizing Model of Jeanne and Ranciere (2011): This model describes reserve  accumulation as an optimization problem in which risk-averse policy makers choose the level of  reserves to provide optimal insurance against a sudden stop in consumption, given the cost of holding  reserves. When a sudden stop occurs, external debt cannot be rolled over and output falls below its  long-run growth path. More reserves mitigate the fall in output and help smooth national  consumption. However, there is a cost to holding reserves as they yield a lower return than other assets  in the economy. In this model the optimal level of reserves is determined by the size and probability of  the sudden stop, the potential loss in output and consumption, the opportunity cost of holding  reserves, and the degree of risk aversion. Based on a calibrated version of this model to Indian data,  the optimal level of reserves in India is estimated to be just above the projected actual holdings in  2014 (text chart).  
IMF’s Risk Weighted Approach (2013) employs a metric that reflects the relative risk levels of  different potential sources of balance of payments pressure—the relative risk weights are based on tail  event outflows associated with periods of exchange market pressure in different countries—and assess  how large a stock of reserves might be needed relative to this risk weighted measure, to cover for  outflows from different sources. For India the metric is constructed as 30% of short-term debt + 15%  of other portfolio liabilities + 5% of M2 + 5% of exports. Coverage in the region of 100-150 percent of  the metric can be regarded as adequate. India’s reserve coverage against the proposed adequacy  range of 100-150 percent (dashed lines) is shown below. In 2014, the projected level of reserves in  India is at 148 percent of the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric (text chart).

Box 6. External Sector Assessment1 
Staff assesses that India’s external position is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and  desirable policy settings.  
Current Account and Exchange Rates  
After a major adjustment in fiscal year (FY) 2013/14, the current account deficit (CAD) is projected to  widen slightly to about 2 percent of GDP in FY2014/15 as domestic demand strengthens. The EBA CA  regression estimates a norm of about -4.2 percent of GDP for India in FY2014/15. However, in staff’s  judgment, global financial markets could not be counted on to reliably finance a deficit of that size, in  light of India’s current (albeit reduced) vulnerabilities. Given the risks associated with global financial  market volatility, staff assesses that a smaller CAD of about 2½ percent of GDP is a more appropriate  norm. This level is higher than the estimated underlying CAD of about 2 percent of GDP in FY2014/15.  The CA gap is therefore estimated to be in a range of -1 to +1 percent of GDP.  
The real effective exchange rate appreciated by about 5 percent between March and October 2014, in  comparison with a 7 percent depreciation during FY2013/14. The EBA REER regression approach  estimates a slight gap of about +2 percent for the 2014 average REER. Staff assesses the REER gap for  2014 to be in the range of -5 to +5 percent, and is in line with the CA gap assessment. The EBA ES  (external sustainability) approach estimates a CA norm of about -1.7 percent of GDP, as the CA  consistent with holding the NFA-to-GDP ratio at its current level (-25.6 percent of GDP).2 
Capital Account Flows and International Investment Position  
India’s financial account has been dominated by portfolio equity and FDI flows. However, the  composition of CA financing has recently shifted toward more debt flows, particularly in the form of NRI  deposits and external commercial borrowings. The financing mix should be improved by enhancing the  environment for attracting stable non-debt-creating capital flows.  
India’s net international investment position (NIIP)  deteriorated to -17 percent of GDP in FY2013/14, from  -12 percent in FY2010/11. While both assets and  liabilities have risen steadily over the last decade,  
10 
external debt has increased sharply in the last three  
0 
years. However, external debt at 23 percent of GDP as  
-10 
-20 
at end-September 2014 remains moderate when  -30 
compared to other emerging markets. Furthermore,  -40 
the maturity profile of external debt is favorable as the  -50 
share of long-term external debt in total debt is about  80 percent and the ratio of short-term external debt to  FX reserves is low. With CA deficits of about 2½

percent of GDP projected for the medium term, India’s NIIP-to-GDP ratio will remain broadly stable.

2 However as noted in the IMF’s 2014 Pilot External Sector Report, such a norm is of little interest, as India’s net  external position is only moderately negative and is not on a deteriorating trend.

Box 7. Asset Reconstruction Companies: A Solution to India's NPAs?1  
Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) carry out acquisitions of non-performing assets (NPAs)  from Indian banks and other financial institutions for the purpose of asset recovery through  
aggregation of debts, debt work-outs, or asset sales.  
ARCs specialize in working out difficult debts, an area  140 
of limited expertise for most banks. Since pursuing a  120 
restructuring requires the consent of holders of 60  100 
percent of secured debt, through acquisition of  80 
advances from various creditors, ARCs are better  60 
positioned to help initiate restructurings. Since the  40 
fourth quarter of 2013, sales of NPAs by banks to  20

The acquisition of impaired assets by ARCs is usually carried out through special purpose  vehicles, which are financed through the issue of security receipts (SRs), of which most—up to  95 percent—were held by the banks that had sold the assets, and the remainder by the ARCs.  Regulatory changes implemented in late 2013 and early 2014 made NPA sales more attractive for both  banks and ARCs.2  
 In the first half of 2014, the share of ARC capital backing newly acquired NPAs averaged only  around eight percent. In turn, the NPA disposal to ARCs became attractive for banks because of  relatively high prices paid for impaired assets of up to 60 percent of their face value (versus a historical  25 percent). However, strong concerns over the effectiveness of ARCs in cleaning up bank balance  sheets and reducing their credit risks remain, as banks, through their subscription to the SRs issued  against the transferred impaired assets, effectively remained responsible for the bulk of the remaining  risk. Indeed, some bank analysts have begun to add the value of a bank’s SRs to their disclosed  stressed assets. Estimates suggest that the amount of SRs held by banks represent about 0.3 percent of  advances.3  
The RBI’s August 2014 amendments to the ARCs regulatory framework aim to address the  misaligned incentive structure of the ARC mechanism. The most important changes include: (i)  ARCs will have to supply 15 percent equity into each SPV; (ii) ARCs will have to charge fees on net asset  values, not the value of the SRs issued; and (iii) ARC assets will have to be revalued after six months,  rather than 12 months. These measures should help the pricing of NPA sales to ARCs better reflect the  true economic value of the underlying claims, rather than accounting considerations or skewed risk return tradeoffs previously faced by ARCs.  
_____________________________________

2 Important changes were the easing of accounting rules regarding NPAs sold to ARCs, permitting the sale of  early-stage NPAs, and a number of measures which improved the economics of ARCs.  
3 With gross NPAs across the scheduled commercial banks at 4.1 percent of outstanding advances (as of March  2014), this represents a notable number. For some PSBs, those numbers are higher. For instance, in the case of  Bank of India, SRs amount to 1.1 percent of advances.

INDIA  
Box 8. Potential Capital Needs of India’s Commercial Banks1 
India’s banks are likely to require additional capital injections over the next several years,  reflecting their challenging operating environment, combined with the RBI's revised guidance  on the implementation of Basel III capital requirements. The challenges on the business front are  embodied in banks’ increased restructured advances, which comprised 5.9 percent of the banking  systems’ gross advances, and 7.2 percent of the PSBs advances as of March 2014. Although not  considered non-performing, restructured assets indicate that borrowers are experiencing difficulties in  servicing debt and thus imply subpar asset quality. The rapid rise of restructured assets in recent years  has raised concerns about the financial strength of many Indian banks. Here we stress-test the banks’  capital position to a sudden deterioration in loan quality and evaluate the impact of Basel III capital  requirements.  
A stress test of banks’ balance sheets indicates that the PSBs are vulnerable to a change in  classification of a significant share of restructured loans as non-performing assets (NPAs). Each  bank’s balance sheet was stressed individually, based on 45 percent of restructured advances moving  to NPAs, and those NPAs being provisioned against loss at a minimum 60 percent.2,3 All banks are  
assessed with regards to their Tier 1 capital ratio  and the ratio of impaired loans net of provisions.

of the weaker capital positions and the higher levels of stressed assets in PSBs. 
Capital injections by the government required to meet PSBs’ Basel III requirements will likely  be moderate, provided the private sector supplies a considerable share (Table). The capital needs  of banks will increase with faster credit growth, and given that banks will be required to hold at least  the March 2019 regulatory minimum for Tier 1 capital ratio of 5.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, or 8  percent including the 2.5 percent capital conversation buffer (CCB). In addition, most banks will likely  hold an extra cushion in excess of the required minimum (we simulate an excess of 1 and 2  percentage points of additional capital). The highlighted cells reflecting results of scenarios deemed  most relevant. With simulations based on return on assets (ROA) of 0.9 percent for the PSBs (in line  with 2012-13 average ROA), the recapitalization cost for the central government is estimated to be  between 0.8 to 1.1 percent of FY 2018/19 GDP, under the assumption of unchanged public-private  ownership shares. However, if the government were to provide the full amount of required capital  injection, the estimate rises to between 1.2 to 1.7 percent of 2018/19 GDP. In a scenario where  government ownership is reduced to 52 percent over time, the required capital injection is in the  range of 0.7 to 1 percent of 2018/19 GDP.4

1/ Simulations based on 2012 data (except ROA and ROE, where 2011 and 2012 averages are used).  2/ A 15 percent transition rate from restructured loans to NPAs is assumed.  
3/ Numbers equal Equity Tier 1 ratio plus Capital Conversion Buffer plus additional cushion of zero, 1, or 2  percentage points.  
Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital will have to be raised beyond CET1 requirements. AT1 capital can  be raised in the form of bonds which are either convertible into equity, or will have to take haircuts, in  the event that pre-specified CET1 ratios are breached. In the scenarios deemed more likely, for PSBs  those requirements will amount to less than ½ of one percent of GDP. However, it is recommended  that supervisors make sure that sales to non-institutional investors appropriately disclose the risks  related to loss absorption inherent in those bonds.  
Under scenarios which assume moderate credit growth, and a continued challenging operating  environment similar to 2012/13, total required capital injections from the government are  likely to manageable. Under current equity market valuations, and the government's announced  intention to reduce its share in all PSBs to 52 percent, lower capital injections by the government may  be needed. In addition, further reforms, especially to enhance the operating performance and the  credit culture of the PSBs will help reduce the capital injection needs.

imbalances from  protracted period  of low interest  rates continue to  build  
M M: Slower-than-expected progress in addressing supply  side bottlenecks could weigh on growth and stoke  inflation, thereby it could undermine macroeconomic  and financial stability.  
M M–H: A strong pick-up in inflation could discourage  financial saving, erode external competitiveness and  generate external imbalances. It also hurts the poor,  especially in urban areas, the most. High inflation  
expectations could increase the economic costs of  bringing inflation down in a sustainable way, further  damaging growth. 
M H: Continued corporate stress could add to bank NPAs,  raising capital concerns and reducing lending in the  medium term.  
External Risks  
H M: While external vulnerabilities have declined  considerably, the impact from a surge in global  financial market volatility could be disruptive,  
particularly against the backdrop of large capital inflows  more recently and weak corporate balance sheets.  
H M: Deterioration in the advanced countries’ economic  outlook would cloud the sustainability of the recovery  in India, both for exports and investment.  
M M-H: Significant effects on the current account deficit,  inflation and the fiscal deficit.  
M M: Rapid capital inflows, increased leverage by  corporates especially those with unhedged FX  
exposures, and strong currency appreciation pressures  would set the stage for disruptive movements in  macroeconomic and financial variables in the event of  sudden shifts in markets’ expectations.  
Continue to address long-standing supply  bottlenecks, especially in the energy, mining and  power sectors, as well as labor market reforms.  Strengthen business climate and address factors  hampering agricultural productivity.  
Raising interest rates until inflation is clearly on  a downward trend. Improved agricultural  productivity and investing in infrastructure to  improve the supply response can reduce food  price pressures.  
Strengthened oversight of financial and  corporate risks. Raising provisioning  
requirements. Policies to incentivize genuine  corporate restructuring and improvements to  insolvency framework.  
Enhance the environment for attracting stable  non-debt creating capital flows, particularly FDI.  Rupee flexibility and monetary policy  tightening. Offer FX swaps to banks to attract  NRI deposits as well as providing dollar  liquidity to oil marketing companies to limit  depreciation.  
Structural reform will raise returns to  investment and strengthen domestic sources of  growth.  
Further shift toward market pricing to minimize  fiscal impact and improved targeting of  transfers to shelter the most vulnerable.  
Further improve the current account deficit  financing mix. Structural reforms, close  monitoring of unhedged FX positions, and  building of external buffers are also key.  
“L”=Low; “M”=Medium; “H”=High.  
This matrix shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The  relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline.

Annex II. Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis1 
India’s public debt remains sustainable given manageable interest rate costs and expected recovery in  the economy’s growth rate. 2 Under the baseline, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to decline  gradually to about 58½ percent of GDP in the medium term from the current level of 65½ percent,  with gross financing needs also declining slightly to about 11 percent of GDP in 2019/20. While the  baseline scenario already uses conservative real GDP growth assumptions, further negative growth  shocks represent one of the major risks to the debt outlook. In addition, realization of contingent  liabilities coming from future bank capital injections and liabilities of the electricity distribution  companies may also push the debt trajectory up to about 70 percent, before the debt-to-GDP ratio  declines gradually in the medium term. On the other hand, the captive domestic investor base is likely  to mitigate the impact of any real interest rate shocks.  
1. India’s public debt sustainability analysis is based on the following assumptions: 
· Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth is forecast at 5.6 percent (at factor cost) in 2014/15,3 and should gradually return to potential in the medium term (at around 6¾ percent). CPI  inflation is projected to decline from 9½ percent in 2013/14 to around 5½ percent in  2019/20. This baseline scenario assumes continued implementation of structural reforms that  do not require legislative approval, and a relatively benign global economic recovery scenario  as outlined in the WEO.  
· Fiscal Assumptions. The 2013/14 central government budget deficit came in at 4.5 percent  of GDP (below the authorities’ deficit target of 4.8 percent of GDP), which corresponds to  4.8 percent under the Fund’s definition. Over the medium term, this is expected to decline  slowly toward 3¾ percent of GDP, while state government deficits should decline to  2½ percent of GDP.  
o Tax performance, especially for income taxes, is expected to improve slightly as ongoing  administrative measures continue to be implemented and base broadening is expected  to continue. Goods and Services Tax is not assumed in this baseline as it requires  legislative changes, including a constitutional amendment.  
o At the same time, savings are likely to be found from reduced fuel subsidies, including as  a result of deregulation of diesel prices, and the planned gradual introduction of cash  transfers should help rationalize spending over the medium term. However, the Food  Security Act will keep the subsidy bill high.

2 The analysis of public debt sustainability is based on the framework developed for market access countries. See Staff  Guidance Note for Public Debt Sustainability Analysis in Market Access Countries, IMF, May 2013.  
3 The real GDP growth rates presented in the public and external DSA tables are based on market prices, as required  by WEO. However, to be consistent with the authorities’ measure of real GDP, the text here and other macro tables  present real GDP growth at factor cost.

o Public banks’ capital positions are expected to be enhanced to meet Basel III targets and  some of the debts of electricity distribution companies are to be assumed by the  government.  
2. Under the baseline projection, India’s debt ratio and gross financing needs will remain  on a declining path. India’s primary deficit is projected to trend downward and remain below its  debt-stabilizing threshold (estimated at 2.8 percent of GDP based on the 2019/20 projections) in the  projection years. Therefore, gross financing needs are expected to remain at around 12 percent of  GDP in 2014/15 before gradually declining to around 11 percent in 2019/20. Automatic debt  dynamics arising from the interest rate-growth differential will on average reduce the debt ratio by  some 2½ percentage point per year from 2014/15 to 2019/20. As a result, the public debt-to-GDP  ratio is expected to fall from 65½ percent in 2013/14 to 58½ percent in 2019/20. The medium-term  public debt-to-GDP ratio is about 5 percentage points lower than envisaged in the last Staff Report,  reflecting a downward data revision of the historical public debt path as well as a more buoyant  growth outlook in the near term.  
3. India faces relatively low risks to debt sustainability under the baseline, but it could be  vulnerable to slower real GDP growth and a contingent liability shock. The heat map suggests  that the debt burden benchmark and the gross financing needs threshold are exceeded under a  contingent liability shock. A financial sector contingent liability shock (which could arise from losses  at public banks)4 pushes the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 70 percent in 2015/16. While not flagged as  a main risk by the heat map, a one-standard deviation shock to real GDP growth increases the debt to-GDP ratio to about 66 percent in 2016/17, lower than the threshold of 70 percent above which the  heat map flags the risk. Both shocks, however, do not change the downward debt trajectory in the  medium term. The lack of fiscal adjustment is another principal risk to debt sustainability in India’s  context. An unchanged primary balance would slow debt reduction by about ¼ of one percentage  point per year on average from 2014/15 to 2019/20, but it does not change the downward trend.  Finally, the combined macro-fiscal shock also has a level effect but does not change the direction of  the debt trajectory. As a result, the asymmetric fan chart suggests that upside risks to debt ratio  dominate in the medium term. The debt profile, on the other hand, is at risk to market perception  shocks and external financing requirements. In particular, market perception is flagged as a high risk  as India’s recent sovereign EMBI spreads have breached the threshold of 600 bps. However, these  two risks are mitigated by the fact that most of the public debt is financed through a captive  domestic investor base, the very small external debt is mostly from official creditors, and more than  adequate international reserves are available in the rare case that external financing needs arise.  Risks that could improve India’s public debt sustainability include better tax buoyancy, a GST and a  revised Direct Tax Code that improve efficiency and lead to near-term revenue gains. A strong revival  of the economy could also return India to the debt dynamics prevailing before the global financial  crisis.  
4 Due to the lack of data on the actual public bank recapitalization needs, the default shock of 10 percent of total  banking sector assets is used. This contingent liability shock is in addition to the public bank recapitalization assumed  under the baseline to meet Basel III targets.

4. There is no evidence of a systematic projection bias in the baseline assumptions and  the projected fiscal adjustment is in line with other countries’ experiences. India’s forecast track  record is comparable to that of all other surveillance countries. The median forecast errors for real  GDP growth, primary balance and inflation during 2005–13 are all close to median among all  surveillance countries. India’s projected fiscal adjustment (an improvement of around one  percentage point in cyclically-adjusted primary balance/GDP over the medium term) is modest and  should be achievable. This magnitude of adjustment is also in line with other countries’ experiences,  with a three-year adjustment in cyclically-adjusted primary balance at 37 percentile among all  surveillance countries with market access. Unlike in the last Staff Report, the boom-bust analysis is  not triggered because India had a negative output gap in 2013/14.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government. 
2/ Based on available data. 
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds. 
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year. 
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar). 6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - p (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g. 7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).  
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period. 9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks.  Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being  presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.  
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is  used to project debt dynamics five years ahead. 
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account  balance. 
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2014/15.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:  
As per the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), the  exchange rate in India is classified as floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined in the  interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes at times. The RBI’s role is to  modulate excessive volatility so as to maintain orderly conditions. On August 20, 1994, India  accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement. India  maintains the following restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current  international transactions, which are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a):  restrictions related to the nontransferability of balances under the India-Russia debt agreement;  restrictions arising from unsettled balances under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with  two Eastern European countries; and a restriction on the transfer of amortization payments on loans  by non-resident relatives. The Executive Board has not approved these restrictions.  
Article IV Consultation:  
The previous Article IV consultation discussions were held in November 2013. The staff report (IMF  Country Report No. 14/57) was discussed by the Executive Board on January 27, 2014.

FSSA/FSAP report was issued in January 2001; a fiscal transparency ROSC was issued in  February 2001 (http://www.imf.org/external/np/rosc/ind/fiscal.htm); the data model of the ROSC  (Country Report No. 04/96) was issued in April 2004. The missions for the FSAP Update took place in  2011, and concluding meetings were held in Delhi and Mumbai in January 2012—the FSSA Update  report was published in January 2013 (Country Report No. 13/8). Detailed assessment reports on  FSAP-related papers were issued in August 2013 and published as Country Reports No. 13/265–268.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP  
In Bank FY14 (July 1, 2013–June 30, 2014), IBRD/IDA lending in India totaled US$5.1 billion (of which  US$1.97 billion IBRD and US$3.13 billion IDA). IFC committed US$1.2 billion in FY14. The World Bank  Group’s (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for India for 2013-20171 focuses on helping India  
accelerate poverty reduction and boost shared prosperity, and is closely aligned the Government’s  12th Five-Year Plan, and its goal of “faster, sustainable, and more inclusive growth.” To make a  meaningful contribution to India’s many development challenges, the volume of WBG support— from IBRD, IDA, and IFC—should reach $5 billion annually over the five-year period of the CPS.  
Under the Strategy, the WBG aims to contribute to India’s development by deepening and  strengthening engagement in three priority areas: integration, rural-urban transformation and  inclusion. “Integration” seeks to increase market integration by focusing on addressing infrastructure  gaps and investment climate as key measures needed to help low-income states converge more  quickly with their faster-growing neighbors. With 600 million people expected to live in India’s cities  by 2031, “rural-urban transformation” will require intensified engagement to improve the  management and livability of medium-sized cities. “Inclusion” will entail a stronger focus on human  development with improvements in healthcare systems and nutrition, on the quality of education at  all levels, as well as on better access to finance and social protection for the underprivileged. A  common theme across these three areas of engagement will be an emphasis on improved  governance, environmental sustainability, and gender equality.  
Two key strategic shifts are central to the WBG program and India’s efforts to reduce poverty and  boost shared prosperity—increased support to 14 low-income and special category states2 and to  urbanization. The Bank is working with the Government to rebalance its lending portfolio, so that  30 percent of all IBRD/IDA lending will be directed to these states, which together account for 400  
million—one-third of India’s poor people living on less than $1.25 per day. Many of these states also  have human development indicators—high infant mortality, high child malnutrition, low female  literacy—on par with the poorest countries in the world. IFC has also intensified its program in low income states. Engagement in more advanced states and at the central level will focus on activities  that are transformative and innovative. Urbanization presents tremendous opportunities, both for  agriculture and poverty reduction, and competitiveness. WBG support focuses on government  efforts at the national, state and city levels to help improve the livability of medium-sized cities.  
A robust knowledge portfolio will complement and underpin financing and includes: (i) focus on in depth analytical work on key cross-sectoral questions; (ii) inform design and implementation of  future interventions by drawing on impact evaluations; (iii) respond quickly and flexibly with

2 Low-income and special category states include: Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha,  Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and eight northeast states (Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram,  Sikkim, and Uttarakhand). IFC also includes West Bengal, but excludes Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

demand-driven technical assistance and just-in-time knowledge support to help reform and  implementation; (iv) broker South-South and across-state knowledge exchanges; (v) develop flexible  programmatic approaches to develop analytic and advisory activities; and (vi) scale-up training  capacity.  
The 2014 national elections brought in a new Government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,  and with it opportunities to further strengthen WBG long-standing partnership with India. Stressing  the importance of WBG as the “Knowledge Bank”, Prime Minister Modi has requested more intense  engagement in supporting six strategic priorities: operationalizing the Government’s initiative to  develop 100 “smart cities”; empowering and providing 500+ cities with comprehensive municipal  services and networks; revitalizing the power sector and supporting Government’s 24-7 Power for All  initiative; supporting rural sanitation, with a focus on behavior change-led investments; additional  support for efforts to clean and conserve the Ganga Basin; and skills development to ensure India’s  global competitiveness and inclusive growth.

AsDB's India Country Partnership Strategy (2013–2017) (CPS) is based on three strategic pillars: (i)  inclusive growth; (ii) environmental sustainability; and (iii) regional cooperation and integration. The  CPS is anchored to AsDB’s Strategy 2020 and has been designed to support the Government of  India’s 12th Five Year Plan (2012–2017) vision of faster, more inclusive, and sustainable growth. The  CPS emphasizes robust infrastructure development, job creation and access to jobs, regional  connectivity, and environmental sustainability. The backbone of the India program will be energy,  transport, and urban services. On a selective basis, ADB will also invest in special purpose vehicles  for infrastructure financing, water resources management, skills development, and state-level fiscal  reforms.

STATISTICAL ISSUES  
1. Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance, but weaknesses remain in the timeliness and coverage of certain statistical series. India has an intricate system for compiling  economic and financial statistics and produces a vast quantity of data covering most sectors of the  economy. India subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) on  December 27, 1996 and started posting its metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board  on October 30, 1997. It is currently in observance of the SDDS, although it uses flexibility options for  timeliness of data on general government operations and on the periodicity and timeliness of labor  market data.  
2. The data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, IMF Country Report No. 04/96) was published in April 2004. It assesses India’s data dissemination practices against  the SDDS requirements and assesses the quality of six datasets based on the Data Quality Assessment  Framework (DQAF) developed by STA.  
3. National accounts and employment statistics: The Central Statistical Organization (CSO) releases a new series of national accounts, with base year 2004–2005 with a dissemination lag for  quarterly releases of two months. Large revisions to historical series and major discrepancies between  supply and expenditure national accounts complicate analysis: these differences have become larger  in recent quarters. Supply-side data remain of better quality than expenditure-side data. Estimates of  value added in constant prices for public administration and defense may be biased upwards, as they  are based on the government’s wage bill (with arrears counted in the year that they are paid) deflated  by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). There are long standing deficiencies in employment data: they are  only available on an annual basis and with a substantial lag, and they only cover the formal sector,  which accounts for a small segment of the labor market. A new series of national accounts with  2011/12 as base year is planned to be released in early 2015.  
4. Price statistics: A revised all-India CPI with new weights was unveiled in early 2011, which covers combined rural and urban India, with 2009/10 as a base year. As well, separate corresponding  urban and rural CPI series are published. The CPIs are published with a lag of about one month. In  early 2015, the CPI weights were updated using 2011/12 expenditure patterns and the CPI series will  be revised beginning January 2015. Since January 2006, the Labour Bureau has published a CPI for  industrial workers with a 2001 base year. Presently, there also remain four CPIs, each based on the  consumption basket of a narrow category of consumers (namely industrial workers, urban and non manual employees, agricultural laborers, and rural laborers).With the exception of the industrial  workers CPI, these other indices are based on weights that are over ten years. The WPI has a 2004/05  base year, for which data are also subject to frequent and large revision, usually upward. New RBI  price series on residential real estate have helped surveillance in this area, though geographic  coverage remains limited, and price data for commercial real estate are not available. The RBI has  started producing a series covering rural wage data, which helps surveillance, but economy-wide  wage data are scant. 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9 
INDIA 
5. External sector statistics: While the concepts and definitions used to compile balance of payments statistics are broadly in line with the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6). Furthermore, trade data have quality, valuation, timing, and coverage problems, and data on  trade prices, volumes, and composition are not regularly available on a timely basis. Only trade credit  extended for more than 180 days is included in the balance of payments (and the IIP and external  debt data); trade credit is often less than 180 days in most countries. Bilateral data on services exports  to the United States and other developed countries are manifold higher than counterpart services  imports published by these same countries. External debt statistics are available on a quarterly basis  with a one quarter lag. Estimates of short-term external debt are presented in the debt statistics on an  original maturity basis. The short-term maturity attribution on a residual maturity basis is only  available annually (and excludes residual maturity of medium- and long-term nonresident Indian  accounts). The international investment position (IIP) statistics cover the sectors prescribed in the  BPM6 and these data are disseminated within six months of the reference period in respect of annual  data.3 Coverage of direct investment positions data is hampered by the absence of appropriate legal  or institutional authority. India began disseminating the Data Template on International Reserves and  Foreign Currency Liquidity as prescribed under the SDDS in December 2001. The more up-to-date  information on certain variables, such as total foreign reserves, foreign currency assets, gold, and  SDRs, are available on a weekly basis and are disseminated as part of a weekly statistical supplement  on the RBI web site.  
6. Monetary and financial statistics: The RBI web site and the RBI Bulletin publish a wide array of monetary and financial statistics, including reserve money and its components, RBI’s survey,  monetary survey, liquidity aggregates (outstanding amounts), interest rates, exchange rates, foreign  reserves, and results of government securities auctions. In 2011, the RBI started publishing a weighted  average lending interest rate and other lending rates at annual frequency. The frequency and quality  of data dissemination have improved substantially in recent years.  
7. Concepts and definitions used by the RBI to compile monetary statistics are in broad conformity with the guidelines provided in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).  Nevertheless, the following concepts and principles deviate from the MFSM. First, the resident sector  data do not provide sufficient information on the sectoral distribution of domestic credit. Specifically,  under their present sectorization scheme, the authorities subdivide the resident nonbank sector data  by (i) central government; (ii) state government; and (iii) the commercial sector (including other  financial corporations, public and other nonfinancial corporations, and other resident sectors).  Second, commercial banks add accrued interest to credit and deposit positions on a quarterly basis  only (instead of the prescribed monthly basis).  
8. The RBI reports monetary data for IFS on a regular basis. Since October 2006, the RBI has initiated the electronic reporting of monetary data, which is a major improvement from the previous  
3 The IIP as published by the RBI values equity liabilities at acquisition cost, while the Fund uses market prices,  resulting in substantial differences.

INDIA 
paper-based reporting which was prone to errors and delays. India has also submitted to STA test  data (starting from December 2001 data) on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) that have been  developed to implement the methodology outlined in the MFSM. STA is working with the authorities  in resolving the outstanding data issues on the development of the SRFs.  
9. Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) is responsible for compiling and disseminating the GFS. India reports the budgetary central government cash flow statement  within one month after the reference month and stock of liabilities within one quarter after the  reference quarter. With the agreement of the authorities, STA uses these data to compile a monthly  cash flow statement for publication in the International Financial Statistics, following the GFSM 2001 presentation, with some missing breakdowns, particularly for expenditure. Data on fiscal performance  at the state level are available only at annual frequency and with a considerable lag. Data on the  functional and economic classification of expenditures are available with considerable lag. There is  also scope to improve the analytical usefulness of the presentation of the fiscal accounts. For example,  classification of government expenditure between developmental/nondevelopmental and  plan/nonplan obscures the economic nature and impact of fiscal actions. The MoF reports central  government data (on a cash basis) for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY), the latest reported data corresponding to 2010. Two years after the reference year, the  Ministry of Finance reports general government data to STA in the GFSM 1986 format, that staff  reworks to the GFSM 2001 presentation for inclusion in the GFSY (latest reported data correspond to  2008). Data on the general government operations are not internationally comparable as they exclude  data on the operations of the extra-budgetary funds, local governments, and social security funds.  Under the SDDS, India disseminates annual general government data within 3 quarters after the  reference year, using the timeliness flexibility option but meets the SDDS specifications for central  government debt and operations.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative  
February 13, 2015  
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report was  circulated to the Executive Board. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.  
1. Historical GDP figures for 2011/12–2013/14 have been revised. India’s Ministry of Statistics released (on January 30) a new series for national accounts—revising the base year  from 2004/05 to 2011/12, and incorporating numerous conceptual and methodological  changes consistent with the adoption of the 2008 System of National Accounts. India’s  nominal GDP (at market prices) was marked down by only about 2 and 1 percent in 2011/12  and 2012/13, respectively, while nominal GDP for 2013/14 was essentially unaffected. These  changes would alter only marginally key ratios (including the debt-to-GDP ratio).  Consequently, upward revisions to real GDP growth in 2012/13 and 2013/14 were also made,  raising growth from 4.7 to 5.1 percent and from 5 to 6.9 percent, respectively.  
2. The official forecast of GDP growth for 2014/15 has also been revised. Using the new GDP at market prices series, the Ministry of Statistics released (on February 9) revised  preliminary estimates of real GDP growth for 2014/15, coming in with an advanced estimate  of 7.4 percent. New quarterly numbers for real GDP growth at market prices (for fiscal year  2014/15) were also released, indicating that growth in the first three quarters of the fiscal  year came in at 6.5, 8.2 and 7.5 percent, respectively. Staff and the economic authorities  (Reserve Bank of India and Ministry of Finance) will be guided by these new high-frequency  numbers, and other series and information on the revised methodology to be released later in  February, in revising 2014/15 and medium-term GDP growth forecasts.  
3. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept its policy repo rate unchanged at 7.75 percent on February 3, in line with market expectations. The RBI stated in its latest  bi-monthly monetary policy statement that the rationale for its decision of no change to the  policy rate was the absence of substantial new developments on the disinflationary process or  on the fiscal outlook, since the 25 basis points cut in the policy repo rate of January 15.  
4. The RBI announced a range of regulatory measures in its sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement. In its February 3, 2015 statement, the RBI reduced the statutory  liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks by 50 basis points from 22 percent to  21.5 percent of their net deposit liabilities, increased the limits for foreign exchange  remittances, and increased the minimum residual maturity of foreign portfolio investment in  India to three years. The SLR was, in particular, reduced to provide room to banks to  increase their lending to productive sectors on competitive terms to support investment and  growth. 
5. International reserves have increased due, in part, to continued robust capital inflows. Net portfolio investment inflows (both equity and debt) have amounted to about US$ 7 "

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION  KEY ISSUES  
Context: The tightening of global liquidity has increased external pressures and  heightened the focus on India’s macroeconomic imbalances (high inflation, large current  account and fiscal deficits) and structural weaknesses (particularly supply bottlenecks in  infrastructure, power and mining).  
Outlook and risks: Growth is expected to slow to 4.6 percent this fiscal year, the lowest  level in a decade, reflecting global developments and domestic supply constraints.  Headline CPI inflation is expected to remain near double digits for the remainder of the  fiscal year. The current account deficit is narrowing, driven by a significant improvement  in exports, robust remittances flows, and a rapid diminution of gold imports.  Nonetheless, India has very little room to adopt countercyclical policies, constrained by  persistently-high inflation, and sizeable fiscal and external imbalances. Spillovers from  renewed external pressures interacting with domestic vulnerabilities are the principal  risks.  
Key policy recommendations:  
· High and persistent inflation is a key macroeconomic challenge facing India. Further  increases in the policy rate will be necessary to tackle high inflation and inflation  expectations.  
· If external pressures from global financial market volatility resume, rupee flexibility  should be the first line of defense, complimented by use of reserves, increases in  short-term interest rates, actions on the fiscal front, and further easing of constraints  on capital inflows.  
· Further fiscal consolidation is needed. Tax and subsidy reforms will be required to  durably lower fiscal imbalances.  
· Enhanced financial sector supervision, better monitoring of banks’ credit quality, and  improved information on corporate vulnerabilities will be needed as a basis for  tackling rising corporate and financial sector strains.  
· Addressing supply bottlenecks and structural challenges—particularly in the  agriculture and power sectors, and in the pricing and allocation of natural resources  (including coal, natural gas, and fertilizers)—will be essential to achieve faster growth,  job creation and poverty reduction.

1. Growth has fallen sharply. Growth averaged 8½ percent before and for two years after the  global financial crisis but has decelerated throughout 2011 and 2012 (Figure 1), reaching 4.6 percent  in FY2013:H1. Initially a problem of stalled  
infrastructure and corporate investment, the  slowdown has become generalized across sectors.

2. Balance of payment pressures intensified during the summer of 2013 as external  shocks interacted with domestic macroeconomic vulnerabilities. As global liquidity conditions  tightened, India was faced with significant portfolio debt outflows, and pressures on currency, equity,  and bond markets. Investor concerns were amplified by India’s persistently-high inflation, weakening  growth prospects, large current account and fiscal deficits, and domestic political uncertainty (Figure  2). In response, liquidity conditions were tightened, limits on FDI and external borrowing were  loosened, capital flow measures were introduced, and gold import duties were increased sharply (see  Selected Issues Chapter I).  
3. Over the past four months, a combination of improving external conditions and  domestic policy efforts have calmed markets. Externally, global financial markets improved as the  U.S. Fed decided not to advance the reduction in its monthly asset purchases. Domestically, the  central bank increased its headline policy rate and intervened in FX markets by offering USD swaps  to oil companies and to banks, with the latter leading to sizeable nonresident Indian (NRI) deposit  inflows. In addition, the parliament passed the land acquisition, pension and companies bills, and  thus far in 2013 the Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCI) has approved previously-stalled projects  worth around 5 percent of GDP. On the fiscal front, measures were implemented to continue to raise  diesel prices, to shrink the financial losses of state electricity boards, and to contain central  government spending. As external pressures eased, the government was able to unwind the earlier  steps taken to tighten liquidity and partly reverse restrictions on capital outflows (Annex I).  
4. Against the background of parliamentary elections (expected by May 2014) and  prospective global liquidity tightening, policy discussions centered on mitigating risks  associated with the challenging domestic and external economic environment. Discussions  focused on strengthening the macroeconomic position and containing vulnerabilities by narrowing  fiscal and external imbalances to create space for countercyclical policies (see text chart), the

consolidation. The stance of monetary policy has been looser than staff recommended in 2012/13,  but has been progressively tightened in 2013/14, consistent with Fund advice. Also, the central bank  has allowed the currency to adjust flexibly to market conditions and intervened sparingly to counter  excessive volatility in the exchange rate. Almost all key recommendations of the 2012 FSAP Update  have been implemented (Annex II) and progress has been made in improving electricity pricing, and  in achieving passage of the land acquisition, pension, and companies bills. Progress on product and  labor market reforms has, however, been limited.

percent but is expected to rise to its medium-term growth potential of around 6¾ percent (under  current policies) as unblocked investments are implemented and global growth improves. As a result  of the weak economy the output gap has been widening, and is now estimated at about 1 percent of  GDP.  
1 These correspond to 4.4 percent (2013) and 5.4 percent (2014) at market prices.  
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5 
INDIA  
7. Despite the growing output gap, monthly CPI inflation (yoy) is expected to remain  near double-digits well into next year. The high headline inflation is a result of a number of  factors, including: food inflation feeding quickly into wages and core inflation; entrenched inflation  expectations; cost-push shocks from binding sector-specific supply constraints (particularly in  agriculture, energy, and transportation); the pass through from a weaker rupee; and ongoing energy  price increases. WPI inflation is expected to rise to 7.4 percent by March 2014, remaining well above  the RBI’s comfort zone and falling only slowly (to 6.3 percent by March 2015).  
8. The current account deficit is narrowing fast. The current account deficit reached a record  4.8 percent of GDP in 2012/13 due to sharply weaker exports, higher imports of oil and gold, and  binding supply constraints (particularly in coal and iron ore). India’s external vulnerabilities have  fallen significantly in recent months, helped by policy actions taken to shrink the current account and  strengthen capital flows. In particular, the current account deficit has been on a marked downward  trajectory as exports improved, remittance inflows remained solid, and higher import duties and  quantitative restrictions discouraged gold imports.2 In addition, non-oil, non-gold imports have  declined in line with weak domestic demand, and capital inflows have strengthened.  
9. Staff expect the current account deficit to fall to around US$61 billion (3.3 percent of  GDP) in 2013/14. The current account deficit is expected to continue declining over the medium term as domestic mining constraints ease, external demand improves, and the competitiveness enhancing effects of depreciation are fully realized. This smaller deficit is expected to be financed by  a combination of FDI and an increased reliance on debt, including inflows of deposits from non resident Indians. There are, however, risks that the current account deficit could be higher depending  on: (i) the ability to successfully lower CPI inflation (which will be essential to generate the sustained  reduction in gold imports and increase in households financial savings that is assumed in the  forecasts); (ii) the potential for higher oil prices; and (iii) the pace of recovery of external demand.  India’s gross international reserves are comfortable (at US$296 billion at end-December 2013, or  145 percent of the Fund’s reserve adequacy metric) and are expected to rise steadily to US$314  
billion by March 2015 (Figure 3).

2 However, the limits on gold imports should be viewed only as a stop-gap measure and have the potential to  become less effective over time (including from increased smuggling). Durably lowering the demand for gold as a  store of value will only be achieved through low inflation, raising real interest rates on deposits, and ensuring  macroeconomic stability.

exposed to higher global interest rates and a reversal of capital flows. Such pressures could tighten  domestic financial conditions, weaken corporate and bank balance sheets, curtail credit growth, and  force a further procyclical tightening of monetary and fiscal policy. This could further raise borrowing  costs, trigger portfolio outflows, and create the potential for disorderly adjustments in exchange rate  and asset prices. Potential upsides to the outlook would arise from healthier global growth or lower  oil prices.  
11. On the domestic front, risks stem from slow progress in addressing infrastructure and  supply-side constraints (particularly in the power and transportation sectors). Unless binding  supply constraints are decisively addressed, high inflation and slow growth will continue to  undermine macroeconomic and financial stability, necessitating a tighter monetary policy stance (Box  1). Given the commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation, fiscal policy will not be able to  provide support to domestic demand, which will also weigh on growth. On the other hand, growth  upsides could arise from further investor-confidence-boosting policy actions (for example, if diesel  price increases were accelerated), a greater-than-expected response of exports to the weaker  currency, or faster implementation of CCI-approved projects. Outward spillovers from an output  shock in India would have modest global implications (given the scale of India’s trade and financial  flows), but would affect some neighboring countries in South Asia through trade, remittances and  FDI channels (see Selected Issues Chapter II).  
Authorities’ Views  
12. The authorities were more sanguine than staff about India’s near-term growth  prospects. Citing green shoots in the data for power generation and exports, good agricultural  performance and robust rural demand, they consider a growth projection of 5 percent to be  reasonable for FY13/14, rising to 8 percent in 2–3 years. Order books are filling up, iron ore projects  have been unlocked, and thus far in 2013 the CCI has cleared projects worth US$95 billion, which  should translate into a pickup in activity in the final months of FY 2013/14. The authorities noted  that final GDP data, using the broader-based Annual Survey of Industries, would be higher than the  preliminary, industrial production-based quarterly GDP figures. They were also of the view that fiscal  expenditure restraint would not have a material effect on near-term growth.  
13. The authorities agreed that a sharp adverse swing in market sentiment prompted by a  scaling back of unconventional monetary policies (UMP) in advanced economies is the main  risk currently facing India. They pointed to the need for greater clarity and communication by  policy-makers in advanced economies in regard to the planned pace of UMP tapering. At the same  time, they considered that India’s domestic fundamentals were strong (reflected in the  oversubscription of the IFC’s first off-shore issuance of rupee-linked bonds), and that vulnerabilities  had been addressed, particularly on the external side. The authorities stated that the recent decline  in gold imports can be sustained, given the introduction of inflation-indexed bonds—offering  households an alternative inflation hedge to gold—and further stabilization of the macroeconomic  situation. They agreed with staff that exchange rate flexibility is an important policy feature that  helps to contain external risks, and considered the RBI’s stock of international reserves to be broadly  adequate to address any need to smooth short-term volatility. 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7 
INDIA  
14. The authorities noted that India has demonstrated its ability to respond to shocks and  market concerns. While recognizing that more chronic problems—such as persistent inflation— have been allowed to linger, the authorities argued that vigorous policy responses had been  forthcoming when actions were urgently needed. For example, when the fiscal deficit became a  matter of concern in FY 2012/13, the Ministry of Finance delivered on restraining spending to meet  the deficit target. Similarly, when markets feared the current account deficit was becoming excessive,  the government put in place effective measures to rein it in and to mobilize over $34 billion in net  capital inflows (largely through NRI deposits).3 
POLICY PRIORITIES  
India has very little space for countercyclical policy stimulus. Monetary policy will need to be tightened  to durably reduce inflation, and high budget deficits afford little scope for fiscal support to the economy.  As a result, expediting structural reforms is the only feasible option to boost both actual and potential  growth, create jobs to absorb India’s rapidly-growing labor force, and reduce poverty.

· Increasing the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) interest rate by 200 bps to 10.25 percent, thereby  increasing the wedge between the interest rates on the LAF and the MSF from 100 to 300 basis  points.5  
3 The RBI introduced two foreign exchange swap schemes in September 2013—one to encourage new foreign  exchange deposits into India by non-resident Indians with a minimum term of three years; and one to encourage  long-term overseas foreign exchange borrowing by banks. Under both swap schemes, the RBI agreed to sell to banks  on a forward basis and until November 30, 2013, USD against rupees at concessional rates, which gives rise to  multiple currency practices (MCP) relating solely to capital transactions. These MCPs are not subject to Fund approval  because the Fund has declined to assert jurisdiction over MCPs relating solely to capital transactions (see  BUFF/85/34).  
4 The initial recalibration of the LAF on July 15 specified an overall limit of 1 percent of NTDL of the banking system.  LAF is a key element of the operating framework of the RBI.  
5 The MSF allows banks to borrow overnight at their discretion up to two percent of the respective NTDLs, at a margin  above the repo rate, against collateral of government securities.

INDIA  
· Tightening the averaging rules for the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by requiring banks to meet at  least 99 percent of CRR on daily basis (up from 70 percent earlier).  
· Undertaking open market sales of Government of India Securities by the RBI (of around INR 150  billion during July-August 2013).  
As a result, the interbank call money market rate was increased by some 300 basis points with the  MSF rate becoming the effective policy rate, money market and three-month t-bill rates rose by  about 300 basis points, and there were lesser increases in rates further out the yield curve. The  preference for these liquidity-tightening measures to increase short-term interest rates (rather than  increase the policy rate) was due to the fact they could be put in place quickly and be easily  unwound as pressures eased. In addition, these measures were more targeted at supporting the  rupee by significantly raising the short-term costs of shorting the currency. A comparable tightening  (of 300 bps) undertaken through increases in the repo rate would have been unprecedented, likely  had a larger impact on growth, and been politically difficult to achieve.  
16. As external pressures have abated, the  RBI has moved to normalize monetary policy. Since September, the RBI has gradually unwound  the liquidity measures by lowering both the MSF  rate (by 150 bps) and daily CRR requirement (to 95  percent) and expanding access to term repos. At  the same time, the repo rate was increased by 50  bps (to 7.75 percent), restoring the interest rate  corridor to the 100 bps that existed prior to mid July. As pressures on the currency have eased and

restore the repo rate as its primary policy instrument has been fully appropriate.  
17. However, inflation remains too high and the RBI will need to continue raising policy  rates in the coming months. High and persistent inflation is a key vulnerability that has caused  household inflation expectations to continuously exceed actual inflation and become embedded in  behaviors. This, in turn, has driven a rising demand for gold and is adding to downward pressures on  the rupee. The RBI’s resolve to pay greater attention to headline CPI in monetary policy formulation  and to strengthen its anti-inflationary efforts are commendable. However, the ingrained nature of  inflation and inflation expectations mean that reducing inflation—even over a protracted horizon— will require significant increases in policy rates, which will weigh on growth.6 Given uncertainties  surrounding the strength and lags associated with the monetary transmission mechanism, an  incremental approach to monetary tightening is warranted. However, it will be important to  
6 As an illustrative guide of the adjustment required, calculations using a Taylor rule (embedded in a structural  forecasting and policy model customized to India’s specific circumstances) suggest that the repo rate would need to  rise significantly over the next six months from its end-November level of 7.75 percent, in order to lower inflation  expectations, tackle inflation inertia, and sustainably lower CPI inflation to around 7 percent by end-2015 (see  Selected Issues Chapter III).  
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9 
INDIA  
communicate the RBI’s policy reaction function and the shift in its tolerance for high CPI inflation  through clear forward guidance on the direction and intent of policy. In addition, should high  inflation expectations persist and inflation remain sticky, a more front-loaded path of interest rate  increases may be needed (Figure 5).  
18. Sustainably lowering inflation will require a simpler monetary framework with clear  objectives and operational autonomy for the RBI:  
· The RBI should move towards adopting the containment of inflation as its primary objective, with  headline CPI inflation providing the principal nominal anchor for monetary policy.7 The evolution  of the CPI plays a key role in influencing both inflation expectations and wage formation.8 While  the RBI should see through the impact of transitory shocks, the current evolution of food prices,  rising at a rapid pace for several years, is not a transitory phenomenon and reflects both  consumption demand and supply constraints. In addition, empirically, food price shocks  propagate strongly and rapidly into non-food, non-fuel (core) prices.  
· To further enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy, the RBI should clearly communicate  how it intends to meet its stated inflation objectives and, as part of that process, should publish  rolling one-year-ahead projections of both the CPI and WPI.  
· In terms of monetary operations, the overnight repo rate should remain the principal policy tool,  deployed in the context of a fully flexible exchange rate.  
· In the context of implementation of the Financial Sector Legislative Reform Commission’s (FSLRC)  recommendations (Box 2), legislative changes should be made to underpin the RBI’s operational  autonomy.  
Authorities’ Views  
19. The authorities agreed that inflation was too high, and that monetary policy would  need to remain vigilant over the near term. At the same time, they noted that supply-driven, food  inflation is a key driver of the headline number. With the good monsoon this year, they believed  food inflation should fall and that, in any case, monetary policy has a limited role in tackling food  inflation. The authorities agreed that the output gap remains significantly negative and should help  lower inflation going forward. As a result, they consider that the growth – inflation tradeoff will need  to be carefully managed and there was a significant risk of overtightening, particularly in light of the  need to create jobs to absorb India’s growing labor force.9 The central bank noted that, given the    
7 The RBI has had both an immediate inflation objective (WPI inflation should lie within a range of 4–4½ percent) and  a long-term inflation objective (WPI inflation at 3 percent). The weight attached to these objectives is unclear, since  WPI inflation has exceeded the target range for the past three years and is projected by the RBI to remain at around  6½ percent in the near-term. 
8 A narrower focus, for example on core CPI, would not be appropriate. See R. Anand, D. Ding and V. Tulin (2013),  “Assessing Second-Round Effects of Commodity-Price Shocks in India”, IMF WP (forthcoming) for a discussion.  
9 As such, at its December 2013 policy meeting, the RBI opted to leave rates on hold, providing time to examine  incoming data on the trajectory for inflation.

INDIA  
risks of derailing the ongoing economic recovery and uncertainties surrounding monetary  transmission, a gradualist approach was needed to disinflate the economy over an extended period.  They were less persuaded of the need for a further, significant increase in policy rates to lower  inflation and inflationary expectations. Instead, they believed it would be prudent to give some time  for the effects of the recent interest rate increases to feed through before revising the policy stance.  
20. The authorities indicated they would take a view on possible changes to the monetary  policy framework only after the Patel Committee issues its report (expected in early 2014). They  emphasize that they have been working, through their communications strategy, to shift the dialog  
with markets toward the CPI, which they consider will enhance the RBI’s credibility on inflation issues  over the medium term. They are not persuaded of the need to release rolling, year ahead forecasts of  inflation, but they made it clear that significant internal and public conversations are still to be had  before the authorities settle on any change in the basic monetary policy set-up.

effective exchange rate appears to be slightly over-valued (Annex V).10 As such, and given the sizable  inflation differential with trading partners, some further modest nominal depreciation from current  levels should not be a cause for concern.  
22. Recent policy measures have been targeted at improving the environment for capital  inflows. India has shifted from a pre-Lehman Brothers era where FDI flows more-than-financed the  CAD, to a situation where FDI covered only around one quarter of the deficit in 2012/13, with a  corresponding increased reliance on debt flows. Over the past year the authorities have taken  multiple steps to bolster capital inflows, including liberalizing the caps on FDI inflows; relaxing  
10 Based on the External Balance Assessment, the May 2013 External Sector Report concluded that India’s cyclically adjusted current account and the value of the rupee are broadly in line with fundamentals, with the EBA current  account regression approach indicating that the current account deficit was smaller than a level compatible with  fundamentals and desired policies. Since the release of the External Sector Report, subsequent calculations by Fund  staff suggest that the medium-term current account norm for India is a deficit which is centered around 2½ percent  of GDP, a level slightly smaller than the forecasted medium-term current account (see Annex V).

restrictions on external commercial borrowing; offering FX swaps to banks to attract more NRI  deposits and increase banks’ ability to borrow; and working with the IFC in its US$1 billion bond  program directed at offshore investors. The authorities have also supported the currency by  providing dollars directly to oil importers through FX swaps (see Annex IV for details of FX swaps to  banks and oil importers and their impact).11 In addition, a swap line with the Ministry of Finance  Japan has been increased from $15 billion to $50 billion, and the government is considering  increasing imports of cheaper Iranian oil, which can be partly settled in rupees.  
23. Further opening up of the capital account should, however, be undertaken prudently. The opening to FDI and portfolio flows which occurred in 2013 will help finance the current account  deficit. However, given the potential risks to corporate balance sheets, a further relaxation of external  commercial borrowing (ECB) rules should be undertaken only incrementally and cautiously alongside  a deeper domestic financial market. Options of issuing a maiden international sovereign bond, if  market conditions permit, and of seeking entry into global bond indices, should be explored. The  authorities could also look into increasing the availability of bilateral swap lines. The flexible rupee  and recent movements in the currency have increased incentives to hedge FX exposures. As such, the  relaxation of restrictions that reduce the depth of the onshore forwards and futures markets would  be beneficial.12 
24. If external pressures re-emerge, a well-communicated package of policy measures  should be put in place to minimize disruptive movements in the currency and bolster  confidence. Going forward, an improving export environment, an easing of supply bottlenecks to  shrink import demand, and a smaller fiscal deficit should help reduce external vulnerabilities.  Nevertheless, if capital account pressures were to resurface, continuing to allow the rupee to adjust  flexibly to market conditions will be essential. In addition, a comprehensive plan should be  announced to:  
· Tighten monetary conditions through both an increase in the repo rate and a renewal of liquidity  tightening measures to make it more costly to short the rupee. Such measures would help  contain the inflationary impact of exchange rate depreciation and, temporarily, bolster the capital  account position. However, liquidity tightening should be seen as a complement to, not an  expedient substitute for, raising the repo rate. In following this approach, it will be essential to  clearly communicate the central bank’s intentions and its motivations for using the range of tools  it has in its monetary toolkit.  
11 The magnitude of the FX swaps is fully disclosed through the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) template  on both the RBI and IMF websites.  
12 Key restrictions include: banks have been banned from proprietary trading in domestic currency futures and  exchange traded options; margin requirements on domestic U.S. dollar-rupee forward trades were doubled to 100  percent; and FIIs and NRIs cannot trade currency futures in India.  
12 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  
INDIA  
· Deploy India’s ample FX reserves, including by again taking oil marketing companies out of the  spot market and offering them a short-term bilateral FX swap window priced at market rates.  Recent experience indicates that this has been an effective strategy in changing market  expectations and, as such, should be used again.  
· Similarly, FX swaps for NRI deposits (at market-based rates and without the subsidy embedded in  the recent NRI swaps) should again be offered if needed.  
· A clear package of fiscal measures, in addition to those needed to achieve fiscal targets, would  help support confidence and lessen the burden on the central bank in reacting to market  pressures. These could include administrative action to raise diesel prices at a faster pace, and  further limit the subsidized consumption of LPG.  
· Measures to further restrict capital outflows should be avoided, not least because recent  experience suggests that they could well be counterproductive, potentially catalyzing capital  flight through different routes. The renunciation of such measures should be clearly  communicated to bolster investor confidence.  
The mission noted that it would be important for the government to develop an agreed set of  contingency plans—along the lines described above—so as to be ready to react to heightened  market pressures. These plans should be fully coordinated across the relevant government agencies  and would constitute a highly valuable preparatory exercise.  
Authorities’ Views  
25. The authorities argued that external vulnerabilities have been greatly reduced, owing  in large part to strong policy actions taken. Gold imports have been sharply curtailed, and goods  and services exports are starting to pick up even before the full impact of rupee depreciation is felt.  FII debt inflows have been negative since May but equity investment flows have remained resilient.  
With only a relatively small amount of FII debt remaining, the mix of FII money now present on  Indian markets has become more durable. The authorities noted the effectiveness of the FX-swap  scheme for oil marketing companies in stabilizing the currency market and shifting market  sentiment. They also pointed to the success of their efforts to mobilize durable capital inflows,  particularly from NRIs and FDI.  
26. The authorities agreed that exchange rate flexibility would continue to be a key pillar  of their response to external volatility. In their view, the broad thrust of the liquidity tightening  and FX intervention policies employed during July-September had been correct. They argued that  with the Reserve Bank of India moving towards improved communication of its views, the risk of  volatility would be further reduced. Looking ahead, if faced with a similar round of capital flow  volatility, they indicated that the thrust of their response would likely be similar, using a combination  of exchange rate flexibility, some monetary tightening, and, if needed, limited use of foreign  exchange reserves. 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13 
INDIA  
27. The authorities indicated that a new crisis management framework has been  established under the management of the inter-regulatory Financial Stability and  Development Council (FSDC). The authorities argued that this group, which has met regularly over  the past few months, should enhance India’s ability to respond to shocks threatening the Indian  financial system. At the same time, they recognized this was a work-in-progress and agreed with  staff’s suggestion to test the FSDC crisis management system, potentially in a “war game exercise”  setting.  
C. Fiscal Policy  
28. There is a firm commitment to meet the 2013/14 fiscal deficit target, but achieving this  goal will be challenging. The authorities demonstrated their commitment to fiscal consolidation by  meeting the Budget deficit target for 2012/13, despite a slowing economy (Figure 6). Politically  difficult steps were taken to raise fuel and retail electricity prices, target direct cash transfers using  the expanding Unique Identification (UID) program (Box 3), and restructure the debt of public  electricity distribution companies. For 2013/14, the Budget deficit target of 4.8 percent of GDP  appears achievable.13 However, weak revenue growth, higher global oil prices, rupee depreciation,  and higher interest rates, mean that achieving this near-term goal will entail significant reductions in  spending. For this fiscal year, in addition to the announced measures to rationalize non-plan  expenditure, the target is expected to be met by requiring agencies to give up un-utilized spending  allocations, and to not release further budgeted amounts to such agencies. In addition, cash-rich  public sector enterprises are being asked to transfer higher dividends to the central government.  Such efforts, however, will create a substantial additional drag on growth, particularly given that  fiscal multipliers on such spending are relatively large in India. 14 Additional fiscal reforms (including  better-targeted subsidies, introduction of a GST and direct tax code) are unlikely to be introduced  before the May 2014 general elections, although there is some discussion of raising diesel prices at a  somewhat faster pace in the remainder of this fiscal year.  
29. The government’s goal of a 3 percent of GDP deficit target by 2016/17 represents a  reasonable medium-term consolidation plan, but the policies to achieve that outcome have  yet to be articulated.15 A better quality of fiscal adjustment could be achieved through a more  balanced package of revenue measures and expenditure reductions. In particular, the staff would  recommend the following package of fiscal reforms to meet the authorities’ medium-term fiscal  target:  
· Approving the goods and services tax. This represents the single most important revenue reform  and will help boost growth by lessening distortions and creating a single Indian market for goods  and services.  
13 This implies a deficit of 5.3 percent of GDP under the IMF’s definition, due to the differential treatment of  disinvestment proceeds.  
14 See J. Tapsoba (2013), “Options and Strategies for Fiscal Consolidation in India,” IMF WP 13/127.  15 Staff’s medium-term fiscal forecasts are calculated on the basis of current policies and, as such, show relatively little  fiscal adjustment in the coming years. 
14 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  
INDIA  
· Approving a new direct tax code with streamlined and smaller deductions, raising excise taxes back to pre-GFC levels, and improving tax administration.  
· Reforming untargeted subsidies on fuel and fertilizer. Continuing the ongoing move toward  targeted transfers will have strong beneficial effects on growth and the distribution of income.  This should be the central plank of expenditure rationalization and will allow spending to be  redirected toward more socially- and economically-productive areas (including greater  investment in health and education). An important step would be to raise diesel prices at a more  accelerated pace, so as to ensure full cost recovery by mid-2014 (and thereafter link domestic  fuel prices to movements in international prices).  
· Targeting food subsidies. The recently-passed Food Security Act—which aims to provide  subsidized rice, wheat and coarse cereals to 67 percent of the population—is expected to add  significantly to the fiscal subsidy burden going forward (Box 4). Efforts should be made to  convert these subsidies to a system of targeted, direct cash transfers as quickly as possible. In  addition, governance and transparency in the allocation of subsidized food should be  strengthened and the efficiency of the Public Distribution System enhanced.  
· Adhering to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (2003) by the central  government. This would imply that the central government commits and adheres to a credible  path of fiscal consolidation, reaching a central government deficit of 3 percent of GDP by FY  2016/17.  
· Minimizing additional pressures on the fiscal position from future bank recapitalization needs  (including by increased bank provisioning) and the liabilities of electricity distribution companies  (by continuing to raise tariffs to cost recovery levels).  
Focusing on the implementation of a more sustainable package of fiscal reforms, as described above,  would build confidence, support monetary policy in fighting inflation, free resources for investment,  lessen vulnerabilities and generate a positive dynamic of lower financing costs and improved  economic and social prospects. Without such measures, the composition of fiscal adjustment will  likely be met through a compression in needed capital spending or an underfunding of important  social programs, which would undermine growth and the government’s laudable pro-poor and  inclusive growth goals (see Selected Issues Chapter IV).  
30. Even without medium-term fiscal adjustment, government debt remains on a  sustainable trajectory, and is projected to stabilize at around 64 percent of GDP in 2017/18.  The public debt sustainability analysis (DSA) using the Fund’s new DSA template suggests that India’s  public debt burden remains manageable. While the baseline scenario already uses conservative real  GDP growth assumptions, further negative growth shocks represent one of the major risks to the  debt outlook, with shocks to real interest rates and contingent liabilities posing additional risks (see  Annex VI). 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15 
INDIA  
Authorities’ Views 
31. The government has reiterated the importance of meeting its FY13/14 Budget deficit  target. The authorities stated that this was a “redline” with strong credibility implications if not met.  As such, no slippage will be permitted. They argued that revenue performance this year is on track,  
and they emphasized that meeting the deficit target does not entail an expenditure cut, but only  involves expenditure rationalization by recalling unspent balances with spending units and not  releasing further budgeted amounts to them. Fiscal accounting in India is done on a cash, not accrual  basis, so the authorities recognize the risk that some spending pressure from this year could spill  into next year. However, they point to the fact that similar spillovers happen every year, and they  argue that there is no evidence that the size of this carryover is growing from year to year.  
32. The authorities agreed that fiscal consolidation was needed over the medium term. In  their eyes, the goal of reducing the central government deficit to 3 percent of GDP (authorities’  definition) by 2016/17 is achievable, but they did not believe there was a need to re-invigorate the  Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) process. The FRBM Act has recently been  amended to adopt this target, therefore, revising the Act at this stage may not be needed. Revenue  enhancement is key, particularly through better tax administration, and the authorities were hopeful  that the goods and services tax (GST) and the direct tax code (DTC) bills will be passed by next year.  The authorities are also optimistic that direct cash transfers—combined with the unique  identification (Aadhaar) system—will generate significant fiscal savings through de-duplication of  subsidy recipient rolls. The authorities do not see significant risks to fiscal consolidation from  implementation of the Food Security Act, and underlined the importance of the Act in tackling  poverty and hunger and ensuring improved social outcomes.  
D. Financial and Corporate Sector Issues  
33. Strains are building as corporate financial positions deteriorate and bank asset quality  weakens (Figure 7). Slowing growth, the delayed authorization of permits for infrastructure projects,  and rising costs of capital are placing pressure on corporate profitability. Average corporate leverage  
and debt payment capacity are not markedly worse than during the global financial crisis, but default  probabilities of the most vulnerable 10 percent of firms are far greater than in 2009. This vulnerability  is further aggravated by concentration risk: banking sector loans to India’s ten largest conglomerates  account for almost 100 percent of banks’ net worth.16 The banking system is well capitalized (the  
capital adequacy ratio was 13.8 percent in March 2013), but nonperforming assets (4.2 percent of  total advances) and restructured loans (an additional 5.7 percent of gross advances) are expected to  continue to rise. The deterioration in credit quality has been worse among public banks where  lending is concentrated in poorer-performing sectors such as infrastructure (especially power),  aviation, agriculture, steel, and textiles. However, despite the sizeable recent depreciation in the  exchange rate, there has, as yet, been little apparent additional strain on corporate balance sheets  arising from currency mismatches (see Selected Issues Chapter V). In addition, new capital injections

16 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  
INDIA  
for India’s banks (to meet Basle III requirements and additional capital requirements due to  restructured loans being reclassified as NPAs) are likely to be manageable (Box 5).  
34. Enhanced financial sector supervision and monitoring, and increased bank  provisioning, are warranted. To tackle rising strains in the financial system, and improve the  functioning of financial intermediation more broadly, the RBI has outlined its plans to further  enhance the monitoring and supervision of banks’ credit quality and require banks to further  increase provisioning. In particular, the RBI’s recently-introduced incremental provisioning and  capital requirements for bank lending to corporates with foreign-currency exposures are steps in the  right direction. As recommended in the FSAP, advances and commitments to interrelated companies  should be appropriately measured and limited, and the existing ceilings fully enforced—this is a  critical measure and should be undertaken prior to issuing new banking licenses (see Annex II). A  further priority should be to gather information on, and analyze, the inter-linkages between  corporate vulnerabilities and the health of the banking system, particularly on the extent of  unhedged FX exposures of large firms with international operations.  
35. Strengthening prudential regulation for banks’ asset quality classification and  concentration risks are needed. Implementation of the Mahapatra Committee’s recommendations  (to more rigorously classify restructured advances) is a step in the right direction, but further  measures in the areas of asset quality recognition and concentration risks are needed. The objective  should be to fully recognize the true asset quality of banks’ portfolios, with restructured loans  counted toward nonperforming assets immediately after a restructuring, and then moved to the  performing bucket only after a period of satisfactory performance. This is of particular importance for  the public sector banks. Moreover, all sectors of the economy (including infrastructure and real  estate) should be subject to the same loan quality classification rules.17  
36. Enhancing the institutional and legal framework for debt recovery is an important step.  This will require improvements in the legal and institutional insolvency framework, the regime for  insolvency professionals, the functioning of the distressed asset market, and out-of-court settlement  procedures. Initial steps by the FSLRC to explore updating India’s financial regulatory architecture  should be intensified, to bring the institutional and legal framework in line with India’s fast-growing  and complex financial system.  
37. Various financial sector reforms should increase credit availability and broaden access  to financial services. Recently-announced plans to simplify bank branch licensing, create  inclusiveness criteria for underserved areas, and enhance competition in the banking sector— including by accelerating the approval process for new private sector banks and opening the Indian  market further to foreign banks—will expand access. The December 2013 introduction of CPI indexed bonds (particularly those sold to retail clients) is a further positive step and will help reduce  
17 The banking sector is subject to a number of additional regulatory requirements, many of which are distortionary in  nature. These issues have been covered in the 2012 Financial Sector Stability Assessment Update (IMF Country Report  No. 13/8).
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17 
INDIA  
the demand for gold and divert savings to productive uses, intermediated by the domestic financial  system. Other welcome reforms already underway include: introduction of a ten-year bond futures  contract; improvement in the recovery mechanism for distressed debt; and establishing the central  
large borrowers’ database, which will improve the supervision of large exposures. In addition to these  efforts, gradually reducing the Statutory Liquidity Requirement, concomitant with a decline in the  fiscal deficit, will help free up resources for lending to the private sector rather than channeling  savings into government securities. On the financial inclusion side, the Governor’s call for a feasibility  study on mobile banking offers the possibility to integrate currently un-banked segments of India’s  population into the financial system.  
Authorities’ Views 
38. The authorities recognize that corporate profitability has fallen, putting pressure on  financial sector balance sheets. They agreed with staff that these pressures, while manageable at  present, will need to be carefully monitored going forward, and noted that other major EMs are  facing similar strains. The RBI is keen to find ways to incentivize the early recognition of problem  assets by banks, and the authorities feel that the newly-adopted Companies Act should over time  facilitate a clearer insolvency framework. The authorities also acknowledge that the foreign exchange  exposure of Indian corporates is not fully clear, but they believe that most such borrowing has either  a formal or natural hedge.  
39. The authorities emphasized the potential impact of a range of reforms to strengthen  financial intermediation and advance financial inclusion. In particular, the RBI laid out the five  pillars of its planned developmental measures to improve the Indian financial system. These include:  (i) strengthening the monetary policy framework; (ii) enhancing banking structure (through new bank  entry, branch expansion, encouraging new varieties of banks); (iii) broadening financial markets (by  improving the liquidity and depth of government securities, money, derivatives, and corporate debt  markets); (iv) expanding financial inclusion (involving better access to finance for SMEs, the  underserved parts of the population, through technology (such as mobile banking) and business  practices (for example, maintaining the requirement that banks open at least 25 percent of their  branches in unbanked rural centers); and (v) improving the financial system’s ability to handle  corporate and financial institution distress (by strengthening financial restructuring, procedures for  rescue of viable businesses, and insolvency practices).  
E. Structural Policies to Boost Growth  
40. Key structural reforms are needed to reduce supply bottlenecks, bolster employment  growth, improve medium-term growth prospects, enhance growth inclusiveness, and reduce  poverty. While major policy actions may understandably be difficult to implement ahead of the  general elections expected by May 2014, any positive steps taken would enhance investment,  improve the supply response of the economy, and help raise potential growth.  
41. Nonetheless, slow action on key structural reforms (introduction of GST, comprehensive  energy and fertilizer subsidy reforms, agricultural reforms, and power sector reforms) continues to 
18 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  
INDIA  
adversely affect sentiment and domestic investment (see Selected Issues Chapter VI). Needed  inclusive growth-promoting measures include:  
· Addressing structural challenges in the power sector and in natural resources. State Electricity  Boards (SEBs) have raised tariffs but much more needs to do be done to eliminate losses. The  pricing and allocation of a wide range of natural resources (including coal, natural gas, electricity,  and fertilizers) are subject to complex and cumbersome mechanisms and regulations, which need  to be addressed. Moving the pricing and allocation of natural resources toward a market basis  would make them more transparent and raise investment.  
· Easing strict labor regulations and addressing skills mismatches. These will be vital to raise  productivity, increase formal sector employment, and improve potential growth. Raising  educational attainments and enhanced focus on vocational training are required to ease India’s  skill mismatch (see also Selected Issues Chapter VII).  
· Reforming the agriculture sector, particularly reducing administrative inefficiencies in food  distribution, pricing, and storage, and boosting productivity in agricultural production.  
· Enhancing health and education outcomes by sustainably increasing spending, improving their  quality, raising the efficiency of social programs and focusing on inclusiveness (as emphasized in  the 12th Five-Year Plan).  
· Strengthening the business, trade, and investment climate and enhancing governance. According  to a range of business environment indicators, India underperforms in areas necessary to run a  business (e.g. trading across borders, enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency) but performs  better in the areas of obtaining credit and protecting investors (Figure 8).  
Authorities’ Views  
42. There is consensus that structural reforms are going to be the lynchpin of an eventual  rebound in growth. The authorities note that a number of long-awaited legislative measures have  been passed recently, and that the Cabinet Committee on Investment is now seeing success in  unlocking key infrastructure projects. Power linkages are well-understood as a bottleneck, and more  effective health and education spending will be key to ensuring that the “demographic dividend”  pays off. At the same time, there is not the same level of consensus on the need for labor market  reform, and the authorities do not agree with India’s ranking on the World Bank’s ease of doing  business indicators, questioning the methodology used in arriving at these rankings. They pointed  instead to the recent Ernst and Young Global Confidence Barometer (issued October 2013), which  ranked India among the most favored of global investment destinations. 
STAFF APPRAISAL  
43. India presently faces a challenging macroeconomic landscape. A weakening risk appetite  toward major emerging market economies, along with global liquidity tightening, have placed  pressure on India’s balance of payments. However, there is little room for countercyclical  macroeconomic policies to respond. Rather, a tightening of fiscal and monetary policies is needed to 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19 
INDIA  
narrow macroeconomic imbalances, supported by actions to relieve supply-side bottlenecks. The key  near-term risk arises from a sudden stop in external capital inflows, emanating from either domestic  or external triggers. 
44. The immediate outlook is for a gradual growth recovery and persistently-high  inflation. Growth will reach its nadir in 2013 on weaker domestic investment and tepid external  demand. India’s growth has underperformed in recent years, largely due to domestic factors (chief  among them policy uncertainty and supply-side bottlenecks). Headline CPI inflation will remain near  double digits for the remainder of the fiscal year, as second-round effects of high food price inflation  continue to drive inflation momentum.  
45. Recent policy initiatives have reduced vulnerabilities. The authorities have taken  substantive measures in recent months to narrow external and fiscal imbalances, raise policy interest  rates, move forward on structural reforms, accelerate project approvals, and manage market  volatility. Of particular importance have been measures to shrink energy subsidies, allow the  exchange rate to adjust, bolster capital inflows, and alleviate supply-side constraints. Continued clear  communication of these policy initiatives will enhance their effectiveness.  
46. The principal risk facing India remains the inward spillover from global financial  market volatility, involving a reversal of capital flows. If capital account pressures re-emerge,  then rupee flexibility should continue to be the first line of defense, complimented by the use of  reserves, tightening of monetary conditions, additional fiscal consolidation efforts, and further easing  of constraints on capital inflows. In addition, to prepare for further global financial market volatility,  the government should design a contingency plan and communication strategy that is well coordinated across agencies and can be rolled out in the event conditions deteriorate. 
47. High and persistent inflation remains a central macroeconomic challenge. High inflation  over the past several years has induced double-digit inflation expectations, driven a rising demand  for gold, and placed downward pressure on the exchange rate. Achieving a sustained reduction in  inflation will require a tightening of the monetary stance, possibly over a protracted period, which  inevitably will weigh on growth prospects. Headline CPI should provide the principal nominal anchor  for monetary policy, as food and fuel price shocks propagate rapidly into core inflation, and inflation  expectations and wage formation are closely linked to CPI inflation. 
48. The continued opening of the capital account and rupee flexibility are welcome. The  current account deficit financing mix would be improved by enhancing the environment for FDI.  However, given the potential risks to corporate balance sheets, further relaxation of limits on external  commercial borrowing (especially for sectors without natural hedges) should be implemented  cautiously. India’s flexible exchange rate will remain important to offset substantial inflation  differentials and respond to external shocks. 
49. Fiscal consolidation is essential and there is scope to improve the quality of that fiscal  adjustment. The authorities commitment to adhering to its near-term budget target is  commendable. While the medium-term fiscal targets and resulting pace of consolidation are broadly 
20 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  
INDIA  
appropriate, measures still need to be articulated and implemented to underpin the targeted fiscal  adjustment. Achieving this adjustment will require more efficient taxation (including through  introduction of the GST) and expenditure (including through reforms to fuel and fertilizer subsidies).  Steps taken to tie India’s social safety net to the UID program are welcome. Reorienting spending  toward 12th Plan priorities in health and education will require further reforms to fuel and fertilizer  subsidies.  
50. India’s financial system is well capitalized and supervised, but slowing growth has  highlighted corporate vulnerabilities and led to deteriorating bank asset quality. The RBI’s  recent initiatives to increase provisioning and capital requirements for bank lending to corporates  with foreign currency exposures are welcome steps, as is the improved loan classification of  restructured advances. A key information gap concerns the extent of unhedged foreign currency  exposure of large corporates, which should be rectified. Improvements in the legal and institutional  insolvency framework would also help deepen domestic capital markets.  
51. Broader structural reforms are needed to raise potential growth, particularly  improvements in the pricing of natural resources. While power distribution companies have  started raising tariffs and are being restructured, the pricing of natural resources (including coal,  natural gas, and fertilizer) should move toward a market basis to boost investment. In addition,  removing infrastructure constraints, easing restrictive labor laws and reforming agriculture  production and marketing will boost potential growth. 
52. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard  12­month cycle.

Box 1. Debt, Inflation, and Growth1 
Containing persistently-high inflation and a firm commitment to reducing the debt generating fiscal deficits are critical for achieving higher long-term growth. The conventional  view in the literature is that public debt can stimulate aggregate demand and output in the short run,  but crowds out capital and reduces output in the long run. Likewise, persistently-high inflation can  be detrimental for growth. There are also possible non-linear effects where the build-up of debt or  persistently-elevated inflation above a certain threshold can harm growth.  
We provide a re-examination of the debt-inflation-growth relationship using recent  developments in dynamic heterogeneous panels, in a sample of 40 countries over the period  1966–2010. Cross-country experience shows that some economies have run into debt difficulties  and experienced subdued growth at relatively low debt levels, while others have been able to sustain  high levels of indebtedness for prolonged periods and grow strongly without experiencing debt  distress. This suggests that the effect of public debt on growth varies across countries, depending  critically on country-specific factors and institutions. The estimation strategy takes into account,  jointly, all three key features of panel data (i.e. dynamics, heterogeneity and cross-sectional  dependence).  
Public debt and inflation are found to have significant negative long-run effects on growth. The results indicate that, if the debt-to-GDP ratio is raised and this increase turns out to be  permanent, then it will have negative effects on economic growth in the long run. However, if the  increase is temporary and debt-to-GDP is subsequently brought back to its normal level, then there  are no long-run growth effects. Similarly, persistently-high inflation has a negative impact on long run growth. A universally-applicable threshold effect in the relationship between either public debt  or inflation and growth is not found, although a statistically-significant threshold effect for countries  that have rising debt-to-GDP ratios is found. For India specifically, the estimated coefficients of  debt/GDP and inflation on economic growth are -0.206 and -0.191, respectively.

Box 2. Financial Sector Legislative Reform Commission (FSLRC)1 
Motivation and reform strategy 
In recognition of the fact that India’s financial regulatory architecture dates back to the 1930s, the Ministry of  Finance in March 2011 convened the FSLRC to propose reform of financial sector legislation. The aim was to  identify gaps and overlaps in existing law which—combined with financial and technical innovation—could give  rise to regulatory arbitrage, forum shopping, and other inefficiencies. The Commission, which submitted its report  (www.bit.ly/16svr5W) in March 2013, proposed a new Indian Financial Code (IFC), the aim of which is to establish  a single, unified legislative framework that could survive for the next 20-30 years. The principles of independence,  accountability and transparency underpin the design of the IFC; for example, all new regulations would need to  be justified by demonstration of the market failure they correct, and include a formal cost-benefit analysis.  
Monetary policy 
The draft IFC does not specify the objective of monetary policy, but rather leaves it to the Ministry of Finance  (MoF), which would issue a statement to this effect from time to time. While not enshrined in law, the objectives  would be quantitative, publicly disclosed, and once set, the RBI would have instrument independence to achieve  them. A formal, decision-making Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), appointed by the government and RBI,  would be accountable to an empowered RBI Board (but not to parliament), with regular publication of MPC  minutes. An independent debt management office would be established. Coordination between the MoF, RBI and  new agencies would be handled by an upgraded Financial Sector Development Council which would have  statutory authority. Capital controls would be regulated asymmetrically: MoF would regulate foreign exchange  inflows while RBI would regulate outflows.  
Financial sector regulation and supervision 
Given the lack of international consensus on best practice, the FSLRC settled on a model whereby a new Unified  Financial Agency (UFA) would undertake consolidated supervision of the entire nonbank financial sector,  including those NBFIs now supervised by the RBI. (RBI would continue to supervise banks.) The Commission felt  that this approach offered the best hope of avoiding the kind of regulatory lacunae that have led to a series of  challenges in recent years: unsupervised chit funds (Ponzi schemes, in effect); under-regulated credit  cooperatives; unit linked insurance plans which straddle insurance and investment products; and most recently  the poorly-supervised National Spot Exchange, which illegally allowed forward derivatives to be traded on its  platform. Enhanced consumer protection is also a key objective of the FSLRC reforms.

Assessment and next steps  
The FSLRC report is not uncontroversial. It has generated much debate, and some of its recommendations were  the subject of formal dissents by some members of the Commission. The FSLRC report is expected to be a  fulcrum for discussions on financial sector reforms for the period ahead.

Box 3. Aadhaar: India’s Unique Identification Number1 
The inability or complexity of proving who you are causes many Indian citizens to lose out on  public benefits, and makes access to financial services costly or unavailable. To address this  challenge, India’s Unique Identification Authority began to issue biometric identification numbers to  residents in August 2010. The goal is simple, yet India’s scale makes it a challenge.  
The strategy is to issue 600 million unique identification (UID or “Aadhaar”) numbers by 2014,  and to reach more or less full coverage by 2018 (see bit.ly/16sigBN). Aadhaar aims to leverage  technology to eliminate ghosts and duplicates in subsidy rolls. Registration sites have been set up in  most localities, and they can register applicants even if power is temporarily off-line. Aadhaar  establishes identity but not citizenship, and signing up is voluntary. Only basic information is  collected: name, date of birth, gender, parents’ names (and UIDs, if available), address, and  importantly biometric data: all ten fingerprints and an iris scan.  
It is the biometric data which renders  
introduction of Aadhaar at India’s scale difficult. 1200 
Each new applicant must be verified not to be one  1000 
of the existing Aadhaar holders—a simple task  800 
when the number of Aadhaar holders is small, but  600 
the computational challenge grows as registration  400 
rolls out across India. Each new applicant must be  biometrically checked against all those existing  
200 
Aadhaar holders. As of September 2013, over 400  0 
million Indians had Aadhaar numbers, and as many  as 800,000 to 1 million new enrollees are added  daily.

Potential fiscal gains from introduction of Aadhaar include savings on subsidies due to “de duplication” of beneficiary rolls (e.g., elimination of ghosts), particularly as benefits are meant  to be deposited directly into special “no-frills” bank accounts for beneficiaries. Thus far, 23  million bank accounts have been linked to Aadhaar numbers, but that figure is expected to rise to  100 million by end-2013. Eventually Aadhaar will also contribute to better revenue performance  when it is integrated with direct and indirect tax databases.  
Financial inclusion is an important objective of Aadhaar. As of 2010, only about 200–250 million  Indian citizens had bank accounts. Aadhaar has been approved by the RBI as a way to satisfy “know  your customer” (KYC) norms, and the UID Authority is working with financial regulators to enable  electronic, or e-KYC, platforms. Among other things, it is expected that Aadhaar will enhance the  coverage and therefore usefulness of the Credit Bureau, making access to financial products more  readily available to Indian citizens.

Box 4. Food Security Act: Fiscal Implications1 
The National Food Security Act is an important effort to ensure that the majority of India’s  population has access to adequate quantities of food at affordable prices. The legislation is a  landmark, representing the largest food security program in the world, involving the distribution of  subsidized grain to two-thirds of India’s population of 1.2 billion persons. It proposes to cover up to  75 percent of the rural population, and up to 50 percent of the urban population, with an entitlement of 5  kg per person per month of food grains at issue prices of Rs. 2 and 3 per kg for wheat and rice,  respectively. Nonetheless, the Act has been introduced at a time when international experience indicates  that conditional cash transfers, rather than physical distribution of subsidized food, have been found to be  a more efficient means of achieving food and nutritional security.  
The fiscal implications of the Food Security Act (FSA) are likely to be significant. The food subsidy  cost of implementing the FSA is estimated at Rs. 124,502 crores (about 1.1 percent of GDP) for fiscal year  2013/14. The food subsidy is calculated as [economic cost-issue price]*foodgrain requirement. The  “economic cost” (as computed by the Food Corporation of India) includes, in addition to the minimum  support price (MSP) paid to farmers, handling, storage and distribution costs. The “issue price” is the sale  price of grain to consumers; the “foodgrain requirement” is the quantity of foodgrains required under the  FSA. Food subsidy costs are estimated to increase to Rs. 140,192 and Rs. 157,701 crores, both about  1.1 percent of GDP, respectively, in FY 2014/15 and FY 2015/16. The “incremental” food subsidy under the  FSA—over and above the subsidy that is already provided under the existing Targeted Public Distribution  System (TPDS, see details below)—is estimated at Rs. 23,951 crores (equivalent to about 0.2 percent of FY  2013/14 GDP).  
However, the FSA needs to be carefully evaluated to take into account not only the cost of the food  subsidy, but also three additional cost dimensions, which can potentially magnify the fiscal implications of  
the FSA (see Table 1).  
· First, if implementation of the FSA includes “grand fathering” of existing beneficiaries, even when their  income levels may imply that they no longer qualify for  the FSA program, then the estimated fiscal cost could  be higher.  
· Second, if implementation of the FSA requires merging  the current classification under the TPDS with new and  more careful identification schemes, then there may be  misclassifications which could raise costs. For example,  there may be pressure to expand the size of those  
classified as “covered” under FSA to include those who  are not truly poor, but are misclassified as such under  the current scheme.

Box 4. Food Security Act: Fiscal Implications (concluded) 
· Third, the open-ended procurement policies of the government (whereby the government commits to  buying unlimited quantities of wheat and rice at the MSP) have implied that procurement has typically  
been much higher than the required quantity of  food grains needed for public distribution  
programs. For example, on average over the last  
90 
80 
10 years (between 2002–03 and 2011–12),  
70 
procurement has been 40 percent higher than the

off-take from the public distribution system. If we  40 
add these costs of additional procurement to the

These estimates of the incremental costs of the FSA should be seen as tentative, as the precise costs  of the current TPDS (and additional welfare) schemes are not easy to calculate. Given the experience  that off take increases when grain is offered at very low prices, and that the estimates do not include  various additional expenditures stated in the Act which are difficult to quantify, the calculations here are  likely to be underestimates. Indeed, other sources have estimated higher fiscal costs of the FSA.2 Nonetheless, full implementation of the FSA is unlikely to happen in FY 2013/14, hence the immediate  implications for the government’s fiscal position will likely be more limited.

Box 5. The Potential Capital Needs of India’s Commercial Banking Sector1 
Although manageable, India’s banks are likely to require significant new capital injections over  the next few years, based on the challenging operating environment, combined with the new  Basel III capital requirements. The challenges on the business front are embodied in the fast increasing restructured advances, which now (as of March 2013) comprise 5.7 percent of the banking  systems’ gross advances, and 7.1 percent of the Public Sector Banks’ (PSBs) advances. Restructured  assets are usually not considered ‘non-performing’ in India, and their rapid rise has led some observers  to doubt the publicly displayed financial strength of many Indian banks. Here we stress-test the banks’  capital position with regard to sudden deterioration in loan quality, and evaluate the impact of Basel III  requirements via a dynamic simulation approach.  
A stress test of banks’ balance sheets found the PSBs in particular vulnerable to a change in  classification on a significant share of restructured loans to non-performing assets (NPAs). Each  bank’s balance sheet was stressed individually, based on 45 percent of restructured advances moving to  NPAs, and those NPAs being provisioned against loss at a minimum 60 percent.2 3 All banks are  compared with regards to their Tier 1 capital ratio and their ratio of impaired loans after provisions. As  of March 2013, the average Tier 1 ratio is more than 3 percent higher for private sector banks than for  public banks, with private banks’ impaired-loans-to-provisions ratio almost 1.4 percent lower. Moving  from the March 2013 data points to the post-stress data, the average Tier 1 ratio decreased by about  1.7 percent for the PSBs, and less than 0.4 percent for the private sector banks, respectively. Mean  impaired loans after provisions increased by almost 1.4 percent for PSBs, and less than 0.3 percent for  private banks. The figure below also shows how the banks location in Tier 1 – Impaired Loans after  Provisions space shifts, with the PSBs moving significantly to the right.

Box 5. The Potential Capital Needs of India’s Commercial Banking Sector (concluded) 
Employing more severe scenario assumptions illustrates the potential for significantly higher  potential recapitalization costs for the government . Assuming that both the PSBs’ NPAs and their  restructured loans double, with three alternative provisioning ratio scenarios assumed (restructured  loans provisioned at 50 percent, both restructured loans and the existing NPAs at 75 percent, and both  at 100 percent), and under a 7 percent Tier 1 target capital ratio for all PSBs, Table 1 illustrates these  results. In the most severe case, the government’s share of the recapitalization cost would amount to  5 percent of FY2012–13 GDP.

The additional bank capital that will need to be raised for the PSB’s based on Basel III capital  requirements will likely be moderate (Table 2). The capital needs of banks will increase with faster  credit growth, and with the amount that banks desire to hold above the March 2018 Tier 1 capital ratio  of 7 percent. For alternative values of this cushion—0, 1, and 2 percent—and using return on assets  (ROA) or return on equity (ROE) as the profit driver, the cost for the central government does not  exceed 2 percent of FY 2017–18 GDP.4 The cells reflecting results of scenarios deemed more plausible  are highlighted in Table 2.

Annex II. India FSAP Main Recommendations and Risks:  
November 2013 Update1 
Policy recommendations 
Risks identified on mission
Addressing system-wide risks 
Enhance RBI monitoring of corporate  indebtedness, refinancing risk, and  foreign exchange exposures. (¶13 -  FSSA) 
Action since 2013 Article IV Mission (Nov. 2012)  
Further risk reduction. Banks were directed to check their corporate  customers’ unhedged FX-exposures and to provision more appropriately  against risks emanating from those in line with formulas provided by the  Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and to exchange information about them. Non compliance can be penalized by supervisors. Although potentially significant  implementation risk on this front still exists, this presents significant  additional progress. Foreign exchange risk and high leverage can lead to  more NPAs and stresses on the banking system.  
In order to get a comprehensive overview of the exposures of larger  corporates, the RBI is setting up the ""large borrowers database."" Banks are  supposed to provide each corporates exposure above certain thresholds. The  data will inform the RBI about corporate exposures, but will be also shared  with the banks. It is not clear how comprehensive it will be at this juncture,  and what degree of the FX-exposures it will capture. 
Improve the performance and financial  strength of public financial institutions  and subject them to full supervision  and regulation. (¶20) 
Further reduction of vulnerabilities and risks. A law is being drafted to  remove members of the boards of public banks who are related to  supervisory agencies.  
Some of the public financial institutions are Non-Bank Financial Corporations  (NBFCs), that aren't subject to RBI oversight. The RBI suggested that they be  made subject to RBI oversight. No change in law is needed for that.  
It should be noted that the FSLRC will restructure India's financial supervisory  system completely, including likely its greater centralization.
Financial sector oversight 
Strengthen oversight of banks’  
overseas operations through (MOUs)  with host countries, onsite inspections,  and supervisory colleges. (¶35) 
Additional risk reduction. Memorandums of Understandings are being  negotiated and signed, in additional to the already signed ones (e.g., with  Australia, Germany, UK).  
Overseas offices of Indian banks representing 86% of total overseas assets  have been inspected so far. 
Enhance formal statutory basis for the  autonomy of regulators in carrying out  their regulatory and supervisory  functions. (¶35, 41, 46) 
Additional risk reduction. See point 2 above (“Further reduction of  vulnerabilities and risks”).  
The RBI notes that it currently cannot revoke the license of a Public Sector  Bank, since they are organized as State Owned Enterprises, outside the  companies' law. The RBI is asking the government to change that. This would  necessitate a change in the relevant legislation. 
1 Prepared by Peter Lindner (MCM). 
48 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  
 INDIA 
Tighten the definition of large and  related party concentration (short term) and reduce exposure limits to  align them with international practices.  (¶35) 
No additional risk reduction. The authorities feel that the current large  group exposure limits that India employs, which are above the international  norms, are needed in order to facilitate financing to such entities. They intent  is to adopt over time the large exposure limits that the Basel Committee for  Banking Supervision will suggest in the future. 
Enhance specialized expertise available  to the supervision function by  
developing programs to accredit and  retain skilled supervisors. (¶37) 
Some risk reduction is taking place.  
The RBI is working on setting up new certification systems. Also, a more  structured and quantitative approach is being employed to training. New  training programs are devised in cooperation with the World Bank's Financial  Sector Development Program.  
A particular challenge exists with regards to the training of NBFC supervisors,  because of the variety of business models and issues that can arise in that  area.

Annex IV. Policy Responses of Emerging Markets (EMs) to Talk of  Tapering1 
The policy responses among EM countries to the Federal Reserve’s Unconventional Monetary Policy  (UMP) taper talk in May have varied, reflecting different fundamentals and policy space (Table 1).2 Some  have deployed a comprehensive package of policy actions, spanning fiscal, monetary and structural policy  actions, while others (particularly South Africa) have relied solely on the exchange rate as the main shock  absorber. This Annex compares the key components of India’s policy response with that of other major EMs.

· India initially conducted limited intervention in the spot market, but mostly allowed the rupee to depreciate.  In August, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began providing its FX reserves directly to oil marketing  companies (OMCs) through swap arrangements (at the market exchange rate). In addition, the central bank  offered subsidized FX swaps to banks to attract non-resident Indian foreign currency (FCNR(B)) deposits and  increase banks’ overseas FX borrowing. The oil swaps and the FCNR(B) scheme both closed by end November, and the OMCs returned to the FX market. The total volume of swaps with OMCs and banks  amounted to about US$10 billion and US$34 billion (mainly from FCNR(B) deposits), respectively.  
· Russia allowed increasing flexibility in the ruble, which depreciated by 6 percent in May/June 2013, the  highest among emerging European countries, prompting some modest interventions by the Central Bank of  the Russian Federation (CBR) utilizing an exchange rate band mechanism to limit short-term fluctuations.  
· Turkey intervened significantly through the spot market by about US$18 billion by end-2013 (representing  more than 15 percent of net international reserves).  
Monetary policy and liquidity management  
Policy rate movements. Facing inflationary pressures exacerbated by a depreciating currency led many EMs to  raise policy rates. Brazil increased the policy rate by 275 basis points (bps) since the start of its tightening cycle  in April 2013, India has had more moderate hikes of 50 bps in its repo rate, while Indonesia has raised its  policy rate by 150 bps since end-May. However, others facing lower inflationary pressures reduced policy rates  to offset the tightening of global financial conditions (Mexico) or to support weak domestic activity (Hungary).  
Liquidity measures. Rather than rely on higher policy rates to protect the currency, some countries also raised  short-term market interest rates through a range of other measures. The RBI in India raised the marginal  standing facility (MSF) rate—the upper ceiling of the interest rate corridor—by 200 bps and capped liquidity  provision at the repo rate (subsequently reversing these measures as markets stabilized). Indonesia increased  the overnight deposit facility rate (i.e. the rate at which the central bank provides liquidity) by a total 150 bps.  Turkey lifted the top end of its interest rate corridor by 125 bps, but left the main policy rate untouched. The  Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) also suspended liquidity provision at the policy rate during  designated exceptional days, resulting in an average increase of about 350 basis points in interbank rates by  end-2013. Hungary, on the other hand, did not face as much external pressures and chose to further ease

monetary conditions by launching a scheme in April 2013 (to be operational in June-August 2013) to alleviate  financing constraints of small and medium enterprises. The scheme was then extended to end-2014 with an  increased funding allocation.  
Capital flow measures (CFMs)  
CFMs have been used to a limited extent. Brazil eased CFMs significantly, reducing the tax rate to zero on  fixed income (foreign portfolio investment) and short FX derivative positions in June 2013. India liberalized  restrictions on external commercial borrowing and FDI. However, the government also tightened restrictions on  some capital outflows from residents (although subsequently partially reversed this measure). Indonesia relaxed regulations on banks' short-term foreign borrowing and shortened the minimum holding period for  central bank bills to attract foreign investors.  
Import restrictions  
India hiked the gold import duty and imposed quantity restrictions on gold imports.  Fiscal measures  
India introduced expenditure rationalization policies and Indonesia, as planned prior to the tapering talk, increased subsidized fuel prices, among other measures. Brazil, India, Indonesia and Turkey all reiterated their  commitment to meeting their fiscal targets.  
Contingency financing  
Several countries made arrangements for contingency financing. India increased its swap line with Japan  to US$50 billion (from US$15 billion). Also, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) launched a US$1 billion  offshore rupee bond program, with a first issuance of around $160 million in November. Indonesia renewed its  swap arrangement with Japan (US$12 billion) in August and further increased its size (to US$22.8 billion) in  December. It also agreed on new swap arrangements with China (Yuan 100 billion) and Korea (US$10 billion).  Mexico renewed its Flexible Credit Lines with the Fund in December 2012.  
Summary: Indian policy response  
In sum, India responded in a manner similar to that of other EMs affected by UMP tapering, deploying a  broader range of policy measures, but the initial communication of the policy intent and composition of these  measures could have been better explained to market participants. In particular, the repo rate could have been  
raised sooner to complement India’s use of liquidity tightening measures. Nonetheless, India’s limited  intervention in foreign exchange markets, and continued rupee flexibility, have served the country well in  responding to global financial market shocks.  
The FX swaps made available to OMCs and banks have proved effective at relatively low cost. By  temporarily removing a significant source of FX demand (which is also highly volatile) from the foreign  exchange market, the swaps to OMCs limited volatility and halted self-fulfilling momentum in the exchange rate.  The swaps involved no loss in gross international reserves, and the resulting forward position is limited and fully  disclosed. The FCNR(B) deposit scheme attracted a significant amount of stable inflows (with maturities  between 3-5 years) in just three months, and the subsidy is relatively limited (3–3½ percent below market rate).  If external pressures re-emerge, these FX swaps could be deployed again, but the resulting forward position  should be carefully monitored.

Annex V. India’s External Sector Assessment1 
The staff assess that India’s current account deficit is slightly above a range of estimates for its  medium-term norm and the exchange rate is slightly above levels that can be explained by underlying  fundamentals. Compared to its trading partners, India’s demographic structure, low per capita income,  favorable growth prospects and large developmental needs justify running current account deficits.  However, these pro-deficit factors need to be balanced by consideration of both sustainability and  financing vulnerability risks, which tend to limit the size of the desirable deficit. Options to reduce the  savings-investment imbalance include lowering inflation expectations to support private savings in  financial assets rather than gold, slowing the rate of growth of public consumption, structural reforms,  and further developing financial markets.  
Current Account and Exchange Rates  
1. The current account deficit widened to a historical high of 4.8 percent of GDP in  2012/13, mainly due to a rising trade deficit (Figure 1). After a period of strong performance,  exports decelerated sharply from late 2011 (in response to a lower global demand as well as binding  supply constraints), while imports have slowed only moderately on account of continued fuel  subsidies, inelastic demand for imported oil, high inflation expectations, and import-encouraging  supply bottlenecks. In particular, gold imports (which are used partly as an inflation hedge) rose  significantly (see Selected Issues Chapter I).  
2. The real effective exchange rate has shown much short-term (within-year) volatility  over the last several years, while the commodity terms of trade has deteriorated moderately. The NEER depreciated by about 30 percent in the last decade while the REER appreciated by about  10 percent during the same period, reflecting the large inflation differential between India and its  trading partners. The deterioration in commodity terms of trade (including oil, gold, and agricultural  products) could have important implications for the current account and REER, given the structural  increase in energy intensity of India, higher gold imports in recent years, and the inflationary effects  of higher food prices. 2 
3. The observed worsening of the current account balance following the global financial  crisis largely reflects a faster drop in national savings than in investment (Figure 1). Since the  late 1990s there has been a sharp increase in both savings and investment rates (consistent with an  improvement in growth), but the widening current account deficit in the last few years primarily  reflects a faster fall in national savings than investment as high inflation and negative real interest  rates caused a shift away from savings in financial assets toward investment in valuables. Despite  that, average private and public savings and investment are still relatively high in India compared  with other emerging market economies and advanced countries.

Model-based Current Account and Exchange Rate Valuations  
4. This section assesses the magnitude of the current account gap and REER misalignment  in India using External Balance Assessment (EBA) and Consultative Group on the Exchange  Rate (CGER)-type methodologies.  
· The External Balance Assessment (EBA) comprises three different methods for assessing the  cyclically-adjusted current account and exchange rate compared to medium-term fundamentals  and appropriate policies.3 The current account regression estimates the cyclically-adjusted  current account norm and compares it to a structural current account deficit (CAD) in 2013. The  second method is based on a RER regression, which derives the deviation of the REER from its  estimated equilibrium level, based on a set of fundamentals. The third method is the External  Sustainability approach, which computes the current account balance that stabilizes the net  foreign asset (NFA) position and compares it to the underlying CAD to measure the gap.  
· The CGER-type methodologies4 use an external sustainability (ES) approach and a macroeconomic  balance (MB) method from Beidas-Strom and Cashin (2011). The ES and MB methodologies  focus on current account misalignments and the required exchange rate adjustments that will  ensure consistency between the underlying current accounts and the associated norms in the  medium-term.  
5. Model-based estimates suggest that India’s current account deficit is above a range of  estimates for its medium-term norm, and the exchange rate is slightly above levels that can be  explained by underlying fundamentals. These estimates are presented in the table below.  
· The EBA methodologies. Based on data available as of November 2013, the current account  regression estimates India’s cyclically-adjusted current account norm (i.e. the current account  compatible with fundamentals and desired policies) to be -4.0 percent of GDP. The projected  2013 CAD of 3.3 percent of GDP corresponds to a structural CAD of 2.6 percent of GDP, implying  
a gap of 1.4 percent of GDP compared to the norm. The cyclically-adjusted CAD is much lower  than the actual CAD as the output gap is small relative to the rest of the world’s output gap and  the terms-of-trade gap is large. These results suggest that the 2013-year-average real effective  exchange rate is undervalued by 8 percent. The RER regression suggests that India’s REER is  overvalued by about 3 percent. According to the ES approach, India’s current account norm is  -1.6 percent of GDP, which is smaller than the staff’s CAD projection for 2018 (the outer year of  
3 See the 2013 Pilot External Sector Report (www.imf.org) for a discussion of EBA methodologies.  4 See Lee, J., G. M. Milesi-Ferretti, J. Ostry, A. Prati, and L. Ricci, 2008, Exchange Rate Assessments: CGER Methodologies,  IMF Occasional Paper No. 08/261, (Washington: International Monetary Fund); Vitek, F., 2009, “Exchange Rate  Assessment Tools for Advanced, Emerging, and Developing Economies (Washington: International Monetary Fund);  Beidas-Strom, S. and P.

the medium-term horizon when output gaps are generally assumed to be closed), resulting in a  gap of -1.1 percent of GDP and a real exchange rate overvaluation of about 6 percent.  
· The CGER-type methodologies. The macrobalance approach by Beidas-Strom and Cashin  (2011) suggests a current account norm of -2.6 percent of GDP (using the fiscal balance  consistent with the desired fiscal position), about 0.2 percentage points lower than the  underlying current account in the medium-term (-2.8 percent of GDP). Based on an elasticity of  the CAD to the real effective exchange rate of -0.17 (as referenced by Vitek (2009)), this would  imply an exchange rate misalignment of about 1 percent. The external sustainability approach  estimates a current account norm for India which stabilizes the NFA/GDP of the country around  its norm (estimated from a panel data model). Comparing this current account norm (-1.9  percent of GDP) with its underlying value (-2.8 percent of GDP), while using above elasticity,  implies a REER overvaluation of about 5.4 percent.

1/ For exchange rate gap, positive value indicates overvaluation. The estimated gaps are adjusted to impose a  multilateral consistency. 
2/ The gap under the CA regression of EBA is relative to its cyclically adjusted value. 
3/ The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach is based on Beidas-Strom and Cashin (2011). It calculates the difference  between the medium term CA balance (year 2018) and an estimated equilibrium CA ""norm"". The latter is a function of  various fundamentals (fiscal balance, old-age dependency ratio, NFA, oil balance, real GDP per capita, real GDP growth,  aid, and remittances). The ES approach is based on Vitek (2009) and calculates the difference between the actual CA  balance in 2018 and the NFA-stabilizing CA balance. The real exchange rate adjustment is calculated to bring the  current account balance in line with its NFA-stabilizing level. 
6. Model-based estimates suggest norms for the medium-term current account deficit  ranging between 1½ and 4 percent of GDP (see table). However, in staff’s judgment, the EBA estimated CAD norm of 4 percent of GDP is larger than can be sustainably financed given the  implications for gross financing needs. Such a large CAD would imply a steady weakening of the NFA  position, calling into question whether global financial markets would be willing to sustainably  finance such a large deficit. Given the potential risks associated with global financial market volatility  (as evidenced by events post 22 May, 2013), staff judges that a CA norm closer to the EBA-based ES  approach or the CGER-like methodologies would be more appropriate, implying a modest 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 57 
INDIA  
overvaluation of the real exchange rate.5 This result is also comparable to the Reserve Bank of India’s  finding that India’s sustainably-financed current account deficit is around 2.5 percent of GDP.6 
Capital Account Flows, International Reserves and International Investment Position  
7. India’s financial account has been dominated by portfolio equity and FDI flows (Figure  2). However, the composition of the current account deficit financing has shifted toward more debt  flows and away from FDI recently. In 2012, FDI inflows only financed a quarter of the current account  deficit, while they generally exceeded the CAD before 2007/08. Debt flows, particularly in the form of  non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits and trade credits, have increased. Similarly, external commercial  borrowings (by Indian corporates) have increased significantly since 2008. Net portfolio flows have  been very volatile in the past and more recently in response to global financial market volatility.    
8. India’s net foreign asset (NFA) position and its composition have deteriorated. While  both assets and liabilities have risen steadily over the last decade, external debt has increased sharply  in the last three years (and is concentrated among the corporate sector). However, external debt at  23.8 percent of GDP at end-September 2013 remains moderate compared to other emerging market  economies.  
9. Central bank intervention has focused on seeking to reduce the pace and volatility of  exchange rate changes (Figure 1). The authorities are committed to a market-determined exchange  rate and have recently undertaken FX intervention through FX swap facilities for oil importers and  NRI deposits. However, with the widening of the CAD and exchange rate interventions, international  reserve coverage has fallen since mid-2011 (Figure 2). International reserves have stabilized at  around US$296 billion, a level which is more than adequate as measured by various metrics,  including the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy measure. Specifically, international reserves in India  stand at around 5¾ months of imports, and 145 percent of the IMF’s composite metric. As such,  India is well placed to withstand external shocks.  
5 The May 2013 External Sector Report concluded that India’s current account and the value of rupee were broadly in  line with fundamentals.

Annex VI. India: Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis1 
India’s public debt remains sustainable given manageable interest rate costs and expected recovery in  the economy’s growth rate. 2 Under the baseline, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to decline  gradually to about 64 percent of GDP in the medium term from the current level of 68 percent, with  gross financing needs also reducing slightly to about 12 percent of GDP in 2018/19. While the baseline  scenario already uses conservative real GDP assumptions, further negative growth shocks represent one  of the major risks to the debt outlook. In addition to this, realization of contingent liabilities coming  from future bank recapitalization needs and liabilities of the electricity distribution companies may also  push the debt trajectory up above the 70% benchmark, before the debt-to-GDP ratio declines gradually  in the medium term. On the other hand, the captive domestic investor base is likely to mitigate the  impact of any real interest rate shocks.  
1. India’s public debt sustainability analysis is based on the following assumptions: 
· Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth is forecast at 4.6 percent (at factor cost) in 2013/14,3 and should slowly return to trend in the medium term (at around 6¾ percent). The WPI is  expected to fall from 7½ percent in 2012/13 to around 5¼ percent in the medium term.  Similarly, the CPI is projected to decline from 10½ percent in 2012/13 to around 6½ percent  in 2018/19. This baseline scenario assumes continued implementation of structural reforms  that do not require legislative approval, and a relatively benign global economic recovery  scenario as outlined in the WEO.  
· Fiscal Assumptions. The 2013/14 central government budget deficit is expected to reach the  authorities’ deficit target of 4.8 percent of GDP, which corresponds to 5.3 percent under the  Fund’s definition. Over the medium term, this is expected to decline slowly toward  5.1 percent of GDP, while state government deficits should decline to 2 percent of GDP.  
o Tax performance, especially for income taxes, is expected to increase slightly as ongoing  administrative measures continue to be implemented and base broadening is expected  to continue. Goods and Services Tax is not assumed in this baseline as it requires  legislative changes, including a constitutional amendment.  
o At the same time, some savings are likely to be found from petroleum subsidies, as the  diesel under-recoveries are eliminated, and the planned gradual introduction of cash  
1 Prepared by Ran Bi (SPR), Mehdi Raissi, and Rahul Anand.  
2 The analysis of public debt sustainability is based on the framework developed for market access countries. See Staff  Guidance Note for Public Debt Sustainability Analysis in Market Access Countries, IMF, May 2013.  
3 The real GDP growth rates presented in the public and external DSA tables are based on market prices, as required  by WEO. However, to be consistent with the authorities’ measure of real GDP, the text here and other macro tables  present real GDP growth at factor cost. 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 61 
INDIA  
transfers should help rationalize spending over the medium term. However, the recently  enacted Food Security Act will keep the subsidy bill high.  
o Public banks are expected to be recapitalized to reach Basel III targets and some of the  debts of electricity distribution companies are to be assumed by the government, in line  with recent announcements.  
2. Under the baseline projection, India’s debt ratio and gross financing needs will enter a declining path from 2014/15. India’s primary deficit is projected to decline below its debt stabilizing threshold (estimated at 3.2 percent of GDP based on the 2018/19 projections) in 2013/14  and continue to improve gradually over the medium term. Therefore, gross financing needs are  expected to remain at 12¼–13 percent of GDP in 2013/14-2014/15 before gradually declining to  11¾ percent in 2018/19. Automatic debt dynamics arising from the interest rate-growth differential  will on average reduce the debt ratio by some 2¾ percentage points per year from 2013/14 to  2018/19. As a result, public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to fall from 67¼ percent in 2013/14 to  64 percent in 2018/19. This is a more modest debt reduction than envisaged in the last staff report,  which projected a debt-to-GDP ratio of around 60 percent by 2017/18. The slower pace of debt  reduction is due to the weaker growth outlook (especially in the near term) and implementation of  the Food Security Act.  
3. India faces relatively low risks to debt sustainability under the baseline, but it could be  vulnerable to a slower real GDP growth and a contingent liability shock. The heat map suggests  that the debt burden benchmark and the gross financing needs threshold are exceeded under one or  
both of these two shocks. A one-standard deviation shock to GDP growth pushes the debt-to-GDP  ratio to 72 percent in 2015/16, while under the financial sector contingent liability shock (which could  arise from losses at public banks),4 the debt-to-GDP ratio peaks at 76 percent in 2015/16. Both  shocks, however, do not change the downward debt trajectory in the medium term. The lack of fiscal  adjustment is another principal risk to debt sustainability in India’s context. An unchanged primary  balance would raise the debt ratio to 68 percent in 2015/16 before trending downward. Finally, the  combined macro-fiscal shock also has a large level effect but does not change the direction of the  debt trajectory. The debt profile, on the other hand, is at risk to market perception shocks and  external financing requirements. In fact, a real interest rate shock would slow down debt reduction  considerably. However, these two shocks are not very relevant for India given that most of the debt is  financed through a captive domestic investor base, the very small external debt is mostly from  official creditors, and more than adequate international reserves are available in the rare case that  external financing needs arise. The upside risks include better tax buoyancy, a GST and a new Direct  Tax Code that improve efficiency and lead to near-term revenue gains. A strong revival of the  economy could also return India to the debt dynamics prevailing before the global financial crisis.  
4 Due to the lack of data on the actual public bank recapitalization needs, the default shock of 10 percent of total  banking sector assets is used. 
62 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  
 INDIA 
4. There is no evidence of a systematic projection bias in the baseline assumptions and  the projected fiscal adjustment is in line with other countries’ experiences. India’s forecast track  record is comparable to that of all other surveillance countries. The median forecast error for the  primary balance and inflation during 2004–12 is at around 1 percent of GDP and in line with other  countries. Forecast error for real GDP growth, however, is somewhat larger than in other countries  given India’s economic growth volatility. India’s projected fiscal adjustment (an improvement of  around ½ percentage points in cyclically-adjusted primary balance/GDP over the medium term) is  very modest and should be achievable. This magnitude of adjustment is also in line with other  countries’ experiences, with a 3-year adjustment in cyclically-adjusted primary balance at  38 percentile among all surveillance countries. Finally, the boom-bust analysis is triggered because  India had a positive output gap in 2010–12 before a negative gap opened in 2013. The baseline  projection captures the boom-bust cycle but also reflects India’s higher real growth rate, even in the  downturns, than other highly-indebted market access countries.

Source: IMF staff. 
1/ Public sector is defined as general government. 
2/ Based on available data. 
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds. 
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year. 
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; 
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar). 
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 5 as r - p (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g. 
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).  
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period. 
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks.  Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being  presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.  
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is  used to project debt dynamics five years ahead. 
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account  balance. 
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2014/15.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:  
As per the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), the  exchange rate in India is classified as floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined in the  interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes at times. The RBI’s role is to  modulate excessive volatility so as to maintain orderly conditions. On August 20, 1994, India  accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement. India  maintains the following restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current  international transactions, which are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a):  restrictions related to the nontransferability of balances under the India-Russia debt agreement;  restrictions arising from unsettled balances under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with  two Eastern European countries; and a restriction on the transfer of amortization payments on loans  by non-resident relatives. The Executive Board has not approved these restrictions.  
Article IV Consultation:  
The previous Article IV consultation discussions were held in November 2012. The staff report (IMF  Country Report No. 13/37) was discussed by the Executive Board on January 25, 2013.  
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:

INDIA 
RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP  
In Bank FY13 (July 1, 2012–June 30, 2013), IBRD/IDA lending in India totaled US$1.3 billion. IFC  committed US$1.4 billion in FY13. The new World Bank Group’s (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy  (CPS) for India for 2013-2017 focuses on helping India to accelerate poverty reduction and boost  shared prosperity. The CPS is guided by the Government of India’s “Innovation Impulse with  Investment” approach, which lays out the Government’s vision of how best to use the financing and  expertise from multilateral institutions to address India’s development challenges and places  significant importance on the value-added of the World Bank’s program that goes well beyond  financing. It wants to partner with the WBG on projects that have a systemic and transformational  impact, those that help innovate and pilot new approaches, and those that help leverage resources.  The strategy is closely aligned the Government’s 12th Five-Year Plan, and its goal of “faster,  sustainable, and more inclusive growth.”  
Under the new CPS, the WBG will contribute to India’s development by deepening and  strengthening WBG engagement in three priority areas: integration, rural-urban transformation and  inclusion. A common theme across these areas will be an emphasis on improved governance,  environmental sustainability, and gender equality. “Integration” will include addressing  infrastructure gaps as one of the key measures needed to help low-income states converge more  quickly with their faster-growing neighbors. With 600 million people expected to live in India’s cities  by 2031, “transformation” will require intensified engagement over the strategy period and beyond  on improving the management and livability of medium-sized cities. The rural-urban transformation  presents tremendous opportunities, both for agriculture and poverty reduction, and  competitiveness. Supporting urbanization is a key structural shift in the CPS. “Inclusion” will entail a  stronger focus on human development with improvements in healthcare systems and nutrition, on  the quality of education at all levels, as well as on better access to finance and social protection for  the underprivileged.  
A second significant shift in WBG support is towards 14 low-income and special category states1,  where many of India’s poor and disadvantaged live. Over the next five years, the Bank will work with  the Government to rebalance the lending portfolio, so that 30 percent of all IBRD/IDA lending will  be directed to these states, which together account for 400 million (one-third of India’s poor people  living on less than $1.25 per day). Many of these states also have human development indicators— high infant mortality, high child malnutrition, low female literacy—on par with the poorest countries  in the world. IFC has also intensified its program in low-income states; annual commitments have  more than quadrupled in the last five years from $60 million in FY09 to $273 million in FY13.  
1 Low-income and special category states include: Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha,  Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and eight northeast states (Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram,  Sikkim, and Uttarakhand). IFC also includes West Bengal, but excludes Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5 
INDIA 
Engagement in more advanced states and at the central level will focus on activities that are  transformative and innovative. Projects are expected to test second-generation approaches, which  overtime could be scaled up and replicated in low-income states.  
To make a meaningful contribution to India’s many development challenges and to meet the  Millennium Development Goals, the volume of WBG support—from IBRD, IDA, and IFC— should  reach $5 billion annually over the next five years. A robust knowledge portfolio will complement  and underpin financing and includes (i) focus on in-depth analytical work on key cross-sectoral  questions; (ii) inform design and implementation of future interventions by drawing on impact  evaluations; (iii) respond quickly and flexibly with demand-driven technical assistance and just-in time knowledge support to help reform and implementation; (iv) broker South-South and across state knowledge exchanges; (v) develop flexible programmatic approaches to develop analytic and  advisory activities; and (vi) scale-up training capacity. Aligned with its regional strategy, IFC’s  Advisory Services program in India is aligned with the regional strategy on inclusion facilitating  access to services for base of pyramid populations, and expanding the private sector’s footprint in  low-income states), climate change, and global integration.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK  
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) operations in India began in 1986. Cumulative public sector  loan commitments totaled $28.4 billion as of 31 October 2013 for 175 loans. With an additional $2.2  billion in private sector loans (the latter without government guarantee), total loan commitments on  a cumulative basis amount to $30.6 billion. These funds have been provided from AsDB’s ordinary  capital resources (OCR). Also, AsDB has approved equity investments amounting to $0.3 billion.  AsDB’s lending and equity activities are summarized below.

AsDB's India Country Partnership Strategy (2013-2017) (CPS) is based on three strategic pillars: (i)  inclusive growth; (ii) environmental sustainability; and (iii) regional cooperation and integration. The 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7 
INDIA 
CPS is anchored to AsDB’s Strategy 2020 and has been designed to support the Government of  India’s 12th Five Year Plan (2012–2017) vision of faster, more inclusive, and sustainable growth. The  CPS emphasizes robust infrastructure development, job creation and access to jobs, regional  connectivity, and environmental sustainability. The backbone of the India program will be energy,  transport, and urban services. On a selective basis, ADB will also invest in special purpose vehicles  for infrastructure financing, water resources management, skills development, and state-level fiscal  reforms.

STATISTICAL ISSUES  
1. Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance, but weaknesses remain in the  timeliness and coverage of certain statistical series. India has an intricate system for compiling  economic and financial statistics and produces a vast quantity of data covering most sectors of the  economy, but these do not always follow international standards. India subscribed to the Special Data  Dissemination Standards (SDDS) on December 27, 1996 and started posting its metadata on the  Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on October 30, 1997. It is currently in observance of the  SDDS, although it uses flexibility options for timeliness of data on general government operations and  on the periodicity and timeliness of labor market data.  
2. The data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, IMF Country  Report No. 04/96) was published in April 2004. It assesses India’s data dissemination practices against  the SDDS requirements and assesses the quality of six datasets based on the Data Quality Assessment  Framework (DQAF) developed by STA.  
3. National accounts and employment statistics: The Central Statistical Organization (CSO)  releases a new series of national accounts, with base year 2004–2005 with a dissemination lag for  quarterly releases of two months. Large revisions to historical series and major discrepancies between  supply and expenditure national accounts complicate analysis: these differences have become larger  in recent quarters. Supply-side data remain of better quality than expenditure-side data. Estimates of  value added in constant prices for public administration and defense may be biased upwards, as they  are based on the government’s wage bill (with arrears counted in the year that they are paid) deflated  by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). There are long standing deficiencies in employment data: they are  only available on an annual basis and with a substantial lag, and they only cover the formal sector,  which accounts for a small segment of the labor market.  
4. Price statistics: Since January 2006, the Labour Bureau has published a CPI for industrial  workers with a 2001 base year. A revised all-India CPI with new weights was unveiled in early 2011.  Presently, there are four CPIs, each based on the consumption basket of a narrow category of  consumers (namely industrial workers, urban and non-manual employees, agricultural laborers, and  rural laborers). The CPIs are published with a lag of about one month. With the exception of the  industrial workers CPI, the other indices are based on weights that are over ten years. The WPI was  also recently revised and has a 2004/05 base year. Data are also subject to frequent and large  revision, usually upward. New RBI price series on residential real estate have helped surveillance in this  area, though geographic coverage remains limited, and price data for commercial real estate are not  available. The RBI has started producing a series covering rural wage data, which helps surveillance,  but economy-wide wage data are scant.  
5. External sector statistics: While the concepts and definitions used to compile balance of  payments statistics are broadly in line with the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual

INDIA  
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION  KEY ISSUES  
Outlook and Risks: Growth remains relatively high, but various factors, including the  unsettled global outlook and slow government decision-making, have weighed on  investment. Inflation has moderated, leading the RBI to pause monetary tightening, but  remains elevated. The slow pace of fiscal consolidation has added to demand pressures.  Growth is projected at 7 percent for 2011/12 and 2012/13, while risks – from slow reform  efforts, high and volatile inflation, and the global situation – remain on the downside.  
Short-Term Demand Management Policies: Base effects have brought inflation down in  recent months, but pressures including from high expectations, depreciation, and little excess  capacity suggest that rate cuts are premature. The 2011/12 budget target is likely to be  exceeded; returning to fiscal consolidation will require subsidy reform which the government  has long committed to, as well as tax reforms, which have been delayed.  
Policies to Revive Investment and Inclusive Growth: Ensuring sustainable growth will  require reinvigorating the structural agenda, rather than relying on monetary and fiscal  stimulus. Measures to facilitate infrastructure investment, reform the financial sector and  labor markets, and address agricultural productivity and skills mismatches stand out. The  FSAP concluded that India’s financial system is broadly stable, but noted scope for some  further improvements in stability and developmental areas. Reconstituting fiscal space and  reorienting expenditure toward capital and social areas are vital to make growth more  inclusive, and also to reduce financial restrictions (which in turn would boost growth).  
Spillovers from External Risks: While external risks are manageable in the baseline, a  protracted downturn in advanced economies could have a sizable impact on India’s growth.  Advanced economies’ bank deleveraging is underway, which so far has been offset by banks  from the region. But a sudden stop of capital inflows would complicate the financing of the  current account deficit. Also, India’s large corporations present an important potential  channel of contagion.

CONTEXT 
1. India’s growth remains one of the  highest in the world, but a range of factors  have weighed it down. Following a rapid  recovery after the global financial crisis (GFC),  the economy has slowed more than most  other major emerging markets (EMs), as  concerns about governance and policy  uncertainty have dampened investment.  Consumption, particularly in rural areas, and  exports, with increasing geographical  destination diversity and sophistication, have  been bright spots. At the same time, inflation  is elevated, and its recent moderation is  primarily due to base effects. While monetary  policy has been tightened, the fiscal deficit  remains high.

Asian currencies in 2011, partly due to India’s  current account deficit. Concerns about global  growth have harmed investor sentiment and  deleveraging by advanced economy banks has  raised the cost of external finance. 
3. The authorities have a broad reform  agenda, which has been implemented only  slowly. Progress has been made on financial  reforms—notably the liberalization of saving  deposit rates and the continued opening of  the domestic debt market to foreign  investors—and FDI in single brand retail has  been liberalized. However, important  legislation to reform taxation and facilitate  infrastructure building is awaiting approval.  Many investors have been disappointed by the  pace of reform of the present government  coalition, which had been expected to

broad agenda for further reform, but with  general elections due in 2014, the window for  passing difficult measures may be short. The  12th Plan Approach Paper rightly emphasizes  power, water, and agriculture investment, and  better governance, health, and education.

has been broadened but malnutrition remains a problem, and infant mortality remains very high.  
2. Ensuring a more stable macroeconomic environment would lay the groundwork for reducing poverty  and inequality. There is an extensive literature on how inflation can be particularly damaging to the poor, who are  unable to insure against changes in prices. Recent Fund research further divides inflation into food and nonfood  inflation, showing that higher nonfood inflation is generally associated with higher income inequality, while higher  food inflation is associated with marginally lower inequality, both across countries and among Indian states.3 Fiscal  consolidation, by reducing demand pressures, would also contribute to macro stability. 
3. But structural measures will be essential in the long run. The 12th Plan will present measures to improve  outcomes in health, education and agriculture, improve infrastructure to reduce regional disparities and facilitate  communication, and to improve governance to raise the quality of public services. Beyond this, reforming  expenditure to more accurately target subsidies to the poor and making progress on the financial inclusion agenda  proposed by the government and endorsed by the recent FSAP mission would also help make growth more inclusive.

BOX 2. CORPORATE INVESTMENT IN INDIA1 
1. While investment was the main driver  of growth before the global financial crisis, it  has been lackluster since then. Strong  corporate investment drove the overall increase  in investment, but it has slowed to 10 percent of  GDP from 14 percent before the crisis. More  recently, the quarterly growth of investment  (gross fixed capital formation) has fallen to about  -0.6 percent on average in the first three quarters  in 2011, compared to an average of nearly  3 percent between 2000 and 2007.

BOX 2. CORPORATE INVESTMENT IN INDIA (continued)  
4. India has substantial room for improving its business environment to boost corporate  profitability, which is a key determinant of corporate investment. According to the World Economic  Forum, India’s global competitiveness fell to 56th place in 2011 from 49th in 2009, reflecting weakening  institutions (e.g., transparency of government decision making) and the relatively slow pace of  infrastructure improvement. The World Bank has ranked India at 132nd out of 183 countries in the world  (up from 139th in 2010) in terms of ease of doing business. In this survey, India is ranked at 166th in  starting a business, 97th in registering property, and 182nd in enforcing contracts. These rankings indicate  that India could do more to enhance corporate sector profitability by reducing the costs of doing  business and improving institutions. In addition, according to the World Bank, there are large differences  in costs of doing business across Indian cities, meaning that many cities in India can learn from its best performing cities.

BOX 3. INDIA’S EXPORTS: THEIR EVOLUTION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS1 
The composition of India’s exports is unique. The share of services exports, which has reached 35 percent, is  higher than in advanced countries, but the share of manufacturing exports in total goods exports is still low.  While services exports have a high technology content and high-value added, the goods and manufacturing  exports are still dominated by relatively low-tech and low-value added products, though there is a clear shift  away from traditional exports (e.g. textiles, gems, and leather products) towards medium- and high-tech  products (e.g. engineering goods). Based on an index of export sophistication developed by Anand et al.  (2012),2 Indian services exports are more sophisticated relative to its income level. However, India’s goods  export sophistication has remained below the average sophistication level of Asia, and it is lower than China’s  and Brazil’s.  
The evolution of exports is expected to help India increase sophistication and diversification further  and should benefit India through reallocation of resources and catch up in productivity. The  sophistication and diversification of Indian exports have reached a threshold that will enable them to acquire  skills and assets needed to move closer to the production possibility frontier. Growth is likely to benefit from  knowledge spillovers. High exports sophistication, particularly of services, is likely to support growth.  Increasing the sophistication of manufacturing exports would result in higher productivity and reallocation  gains similar to those seen in the services sector. Going forward, India could benefit from realizing exports with  new regions: even though exports to emerging and developing economies have increased, the potential to  increase them further is substantial.  
However, realizing these benefits will require trade reforms, investment in infrastructure, health and  education, and labor market reforms. The key trade reform areas are reducing trade restrictiveness and  improving trade facilitation and infrastructure. India’s weighted average tariff is high relative to other G20  economies. Also, India scores much below comparator Asian economies on the Overall Logistic Performance  Index. A substantial investment in infrastructure, health, and education (both basic and technical) will be  needed to sustain and increase sophistication. In addition, labor law reforms will be necessary to realize  efficiency and productivity gains in manufacturing.

between PMI input and output prices, is still  strong. While profit margins may continue to  drop, inflation pressures could take time to  ease as there is little or no excess capacity.  Nominal wage growth has outpaced inflation  since 2010. Expectations have drifted upwards,  in part because consumer price inflation, which  weighs food heavily, has been above 7 percent  for almost four years. Rising incomes,  
have led to increased pass-through from the  repo rate to lending rates. However, the  depreciation of the NEER since July (about  8 percent) has partly offset interest rate hikes.  While the RBI in January 2012 cut cash reserve  requirements by 50 basis points citing tighter than-expected liquidity, it added that policy  rates will not be cut until inflation has  moderated sustainably.

9. The fiscal deficit remains high,  adding to demand pressures. The modest  decline in the deficit to GDP ratio in 2010/11  resulted mostly from one-off measures  (Figure 3). With limited progress on subsidy  reforms and oil prices remaining firm, the  2011/12 deficit target is likely to exceed the  target by about 1 percent of GDP, despite a  slower pace of capital spending compared  with previous years. A midyear rise in fuel  prices mitigated spending pressures, but the  subsidy bill is still likely to exceed the budget  by a substantial amount. Corporate tax  revenues have been hit by the slowing  economy and measures to broaden the base  of services taxation were partly offset by  cutting indirect taxes on fuels. Public debt  declined to 67 percent of GDP in March 2011,  due to high nominal GDP growth.  
10. Growth is projected at about  7 percent for 2011/12 and 2012/13, with  inflation forecast to remain above the RBI’s  comfort zone. Investment is anticipated to  pick up modestly from the slump recorded in  2011Q3, as indicators of capital goods  
and 3 percent medium-term, objectives. The  current account deficit is projected to widen  slightly to 2.8 percent of GDP, as exports  soften along with the global economy and oil  prices remain high.  
11. Growth risks are to the downside.  The main domestic risk is a further weakening  of private investment if government approvals  of projects do not accelerate, reform efforts  are not reinvigorated, and inflation remains  high and volatile (Box 4). At the same time,  external risks continue to be elevated as Euro  area growth could underperform and bank  deleveraging could intensify even in the  absence of a new full-fledged global financial  crisis (discussed separately below).

Staff assessment: MEDIUM 
Strong investment growth will require  speeding up government decision making  and approvals, as well as substantial  progress on the reform agenda. 
Staff assessment: MEDIUM  
Supply constraints could cause prices,  especially of food items, to accelerate  once base effects dissipate. Also,  
momentum indicators are mixed.

Lower investment would reduce potential  GDP growth, dimming India’s long-term  prospects. A continued slowdown would  lead to rising NPAs (see attached FSSA)  and other financial stresses, and would  add to fiscal risks.  
Staff assessment: MEDIUM to HIGH  
 Should inflation rise again confidence in  macroeconomic management could harm  investment, while disinflation could  require substantial monetary tightening,  weighing on growth.  
Staff assessment: HIGH  
Investment and confidence are already  weak, and a deterioration in the global  outlook would cause further damage,  while a drying up of financial markets  would complicate the financing of the  current account deficit and cause severe  domestic dislocation, at least in the short  term. With less policy space than in  2008/09, it is unlikely that countercyclical  policy could be as effective as during the  GFC.  
Fiscal expansion Staff assessment: MEDIUM  
Crowding out could hurt investment,  
while microeconomic distortions from  
further market interventions could  
depress productivity. Interest rates would

and inflation starting to ease. They estimate  growth to be between 7-7.5 percent in  2011/12 and expect that it will pick up in the  second half of 2012/13. While taking note of  the recent moderation of quarterly growth  rates, the authorities expect investment to  recover as financial conditions ease and  domestic sentiment improves. The trade  balance has widened slightly in 2011/12, but  the recent depreciation of the rupee and the  continued strength of Indian exports are  expected to keep it contained. These factors,  combined with continued strength in  consumption, are expected to bring growth in  2012/13 back toward the trend range of  8-8½ percent, provided global financial risks  do not materialize.  
13. External factors weigh more heavily  in the authorities’ assessment of the current  situation, especially energy prices. Further  deleveraging by European banks may have  limited direct impact but second order effects  on Indian banks might materialize through

trade, finance and confidence channels. Since  mid-2011, a deteriorating outlook in advanced  economies has manifested in EMs, including  India, through capital outflows, while  commodity prices remain high. In 2008/09,  sharply lower oil prices helped bring Indian  inflation down, allowing for monetary easing  while reducing the trade deficit. These  beneficial effects have not occurred during the  past year.  
14. The RBI stresses that vigilance  continues to be warranted on inflation. Disinflation could be complicated by structural  factors resurfacing as pressure on food prices,  especially of protein items, as well as by weak  government finances and adjustments to  petroleum and coal prices, which remain  significantly below international prices. Noting  wage-price dynamics and expectations  formation in India, the RBI remains concerned  about inflation risks and will look out for a  sustained moderation in inflation before  lowering the policy rate.

period of time. Base effects are expected to  persist and keep inflation slightly below the  RBI’s end-March projection of 7 percent. This  would bring the real repo rate toward its  historical average of 1.5-2 percent and  broadly in line with the level implied by a  standard Taylor rule.3 Nevertheless, given  structural pressures on food prices, little or no  excess capacity, high nominal wage growth,  inflation expectations that have drifted  upwards, and the rupee depreciation still to  pass through completely, vigilance is required  against the possibility that, after base effects  wear off, inflation could rise again.

BOX 5. THE OUTPUT-INFLATION TRADE-OFF IN INDIA: IMPLICATIONS FOR DISINFLATION1 
1. The detrimental effects of high inflation on growth are well documented in the literature. For example, Khan and Senhadji (“Threshold Effects in the Relationship between Inflation and Growth,”  IMF Working Paper 00/110, 2000) indicate that high inflation hurts growth, and identify different inflation  levels for advanced (1-3 percent) and developing economies (7-11 percent) above which inflation begins  to hurt growth.  
2. Several papers have estimated that inflation beyond 5-6 percent is detrimental to growth  in India. Ahluwalia (“Prospects and Policy Challenges in the Twelfth Plan”, Economic and Political Weekly,  May 2011) notes that inflation above 6 percent is “regressive and also distortionary, damaging both  inclusion and growth”. Mohanty et al. (“Empirical Threshold in India: An Empirical Investigation”, RBI  Working Paper 18/2011, 2011) find evidence of an inflation threshold for India in the order of 5.5 percent.  Using quarterly data from 1996-2011, we also find evidence that puts the inflation threshold at 5-6  percent for India.  
3. Threshold analysis can also be used to shed light on the nature of the inflation-output  tradeoff at different levels of inflation. For this, we use a backward-looking Phillips curve (PC) model,  and apply quantile regression which allows the estimated slope parameter to differ depending on the  level of inflation. We also conduct standard OLS regressions to compare results. The estimated equation  is given by: 
<U+0B6E> ß<U+0B67>,<U+0BA4>p<U+0B72><U+0B3F><U+0B67> <U+0D45> <U+03B3><U+0BA4><U+123A>y<U+0B72> <U+0D46> y<U+0B72><U+05DB><U+123B> <U+0D45> e<U+0B72> 
Q<U+0BA4><U+123A>p<U+0B72><U+123B> <U+0D4C> <U+2211><U+0B67><U+0B40><U+0B35> 
where <U+03B3> is the slope of the PC and t refers to the t th quantile of the dependent variable (i.e., any  particular level of inflation for which <U+03B3> is to be estimated). Other controls are included, such as real oil  prices.  
4. The estimated Phillips curves confirm that the tradeoff between inflation and output  differs at different levels of inflation. The standard OLS regression shows that a 1 percentage point  increase in the output gap leads to a 0.4 percentage  
point increase in inflation. This implies large disinflation  costs; for instance, growth needs to be below potential  1.6 
by 2 percentage points (assuming unchanged potential  1.2 
growth of 7.8 percent) for inflation to drop by  
0.8 
1 percentage point. But more importantly, quantile  0.4 
regression estimates suggest that the cost of

In addition to the changing slope of the PC, inflation  becomes more inertial at higher levels. This is consistent  with recent anecdotal evidence that wage indexation  has become more widespread and survey evidence

Authorities’ Views  
18. The authorities expect inflation to  reach the March 2012 projection  (7.0 percent), and show some further  decline in 2012-13. The authorities believe  manufacturing inflation could soften,  although momentum indicators remain flat,  which along with favorable base effects will  bring headline inflation down. The RBI also  judges that the pass-through from rupee  depreciation has already largely taken place,  and notes that below-potential growth in  2012 would reduce firms’ pricing power.  
19. The interest rate cycle has peaked,  but not yet turned. Tighter policy has  successfully eased demand-side pressures  and cooled growth, though tightening has  been amplified by external shocks. The RBI  
the basis of different economic groups that  have been compiled since the early 1950s.  However, as the national CPI was introduced  only in 2011, the WPI remains the only  established national price index. In addition,  the higher weight of food in the CPI means its  basket is likely to be less responsive to  demand-management measures such as  monetary policy. Therefore, the RBI will  continue to use a multiple-indicator approach,  looking at developments in WPI and CPIs, as  well as various other indicators of inflation  and economic activity.  
21. The authorities agree that the  2011/12 budget target is likely to be  exceeded. Noting that the buoyancy of  
indirect taxes was likely to compensate for the  reduction in fuel taxation, the authorities  anticipate that revenue shortfalls would be  
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15 
INDIA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT  
minimal. Fertilizer and fuel subsidies have  exceeded budget estimates, due to high  global commodity prices, but these losses can  be contained. The slow pace of fiscal  consolidation has added to inflation  challenges. Noting that long-term interest  
rates did not react as strongly to the  December 2011 announcement of additional  borrowing as they did to the September  announcement, the authorities believe that  crowding out is not a pressing issue now.  
B. How to Revive Investment and Facilitate Inclusive Growth?  
22. Implementing structural reforms to  revive investment is crucial for ensuring  sustainable growth. Persistently high inflation  shows that supply constraints are binding. To  lessen these constraints and reverse the  slowdown, investment must rise. Alternatively,  protracted weak investment would initially  lower demand, but more worryingly, over time  would reduce potential growth. Better  infrastructure, more efficient provision of  public services, less restrictive labor laws, and a  larger manufacturing sector can all stimulate  investment. On the other hand, demand  management policies can only provide limited  impetus to growth, given the high fiscal deficit  and the continued need to bring inflation  down.  
23. To reinvigorate investment, there  are some key areas for focus. Staff research  shows that there is ample room for India’s  business environment to improve, indicating a  high potential for structural reforms, and given  wide variations across cities, India can learn  from itself (see Box 2). Enhancing clarity and  predictability of regulations, and accelerating  approval processes under such regulations, is  vital for reforms to bear tangible fruit. Also,  
some of these measures are under the states’  purview, and hence states’ regulations and  practices would also need to be adjusted. Key  reform areas are:  
· Infrastructure, including by simplifying  permitting procedures and making  
contracts more enforceable, facilitating  land acquisition and making it more  predictable and equitable. Speeding up  reforms in the power sector is an urgent  priority, particularly through better  
allocation of domestic coal, bringing state  electricity boards’ finances on a sustainable  footing, and reforming coal pricing and  electricity tariffs.  
· Financial markets, while developing  rapidly, still retain important roadblocks to  faster growth. Due to the predominance of  government securities in financial  
institutions’ portfolios, both private sector  credit and the corporate bond market are  small relative to EMs, though less so  relative to countries with similar per capital  income. 
16 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT 
· India’s labor regulation, which is tighter  than in most OECD countries, should move  toward protecting workers rather than  jobs; improving workers’ skills is another  priority (More and Better Jobs in South Asia,  World Bank, 2011).  
Private Sector Credit and Corporate Bonds, 2011 (In percent of GDP)

· Improved agricultural productivity, a focus  of the 12th Plan, would reduce structural  pressures on food prices. FDI in the  multibrand retail sector could also help by  making supply chains more efficient.  
· Trade liberalization, an educated work  force, access to information flows and  technology are all associated with  
increased sophistication of exports and  productivity (see Box 3).  
24. Many of these reforms would pay  dividends on inclusiveness. Improved  infrastructure would enhance the rural poor’s  access to markets.

26. The authorities cite numerous areas  where progress on structural reform has  been made. Interest rate liberalization has  been completed, FDI regulation has been  eased, amendments to the law governing the  Life Insurance Corporation of India to boost its  capital have been approved, the National  Manufacturing Strategy has been proposed  with the aim to increase the share of  manufacturing, and the Land Acquisition and  Mining Laws, which should facilitate  infrastructure building, have been submitted to  Parliament. On the crucial energy sector,  lending to state electricity boards has been  conditioned on raising tariffs (which some  states have done) and reducing transmission  and distribution losses.

27. The government will push forward  with further measures in 2012/13. The  2012/13 Budget is expected to reduce  investment roadblocks, particularly in areas  such as infrastructure and agriculture.  Negotiations related to the GST are ongoing,  and recent progress bodes well. The  
Financial Stability and Reform  
28. The FSAP concluded that the  financial system is broadly stable but some  areas could be strengthened (see  accompanying FSSA). India’s financial system  has developed rapidly in recent years and  capital ratios as well as return on assets are  adequate. However, non performing assets  (NPAs) rose 30 percent in the year to  September 2011 to 2.8 percent of total  advances (partly reflecting problems in priority  lending, infrastructure, and accounts  restructured during the GFC), provision  coverage remains low, and hybrid structures  account for a relatively high proportion of  capital. The authorities have moved to tie  public bank recapitalization to improved  performance, and increased inter-regulatory  information sharing. However, an important  risk is that concentration limits are  
considerably less stringent than international  good practice. Increased oversight of  corporate risks (including FX open positions)  and stronger consolidated supervision by lead  regulators are warranted. Granting greater  powers to supervisors would also help resolve  nonviable financial entities.  
authorities plan to address other areas, such as  the need to reduce skills mismatches and  improve agricultural productivity, in the 12th Plan. Finally, the authorities noted that  broadening the benefits of economic reform  will be a priority under the 12th Plan.  
29. Enhancing infrastructure financing is  a key area of focus for financial sector  development.4 Public banks’ lending cannot  keep pace with rising needs without raising  sectoral and group exposures and asset liability mismatches to imprudent levels, which  underscores the need to diversify funding  sources beyond banks. In recent years, the  authorities have taken steps to channel more  savings into infrastructure. They have raised  limits on foreign investment (FII) in bonds and  enabled infrastructure finance companies to  buy seasoned infrastructure loans and borrow  abroad. Uptake on many of these measures  has been low, however, reflecting nonfinancial  and scheme design issues, and insufficient  bond market liquidity.  
30. Continued reforms to fixed-income  markets, especially the development of the  corporate bond market, would facilitate

Lowering mandatory bank holdings  of public debt (the statutory liquidity ratio,  SLR), encouraging banks to trade bonds (e.g.  by increasing the share of bonds that must be  marked to market) and relaxing restrictions on  repo collateral and CDS while continuing to  raise FII debt limits would increase liquidity  and facilitate the development of a yield curve  for pricing corporate bonds. Easing investment  guidelines for domestic institutional investors,  and relaxing restrictions on credit  
enhancements would increase demand for  corporate bonds. Approving the Pension Fund  Regulatory and Development Agency (PFRDA)  bill would give impetus to the pension fund  industry and promote long-term investments.  Improving the insolvency regime, increasing  investor protection, and continuing to develop  instruments to hedge interest rate risk would  also help.  
31. Broadening the reach of the  financial system can support inclusive  growth. Easing regulations that raise the cost  for banks to operate in underserved areas and  allowing a greater role for business  
correspondents is needed to extend banking  services to the unbanked. Greater SME  financing requires larger corporates shifting to  capital markets and more effective contract  enforceability. 
Authorities’ Views 
32. The authorities view the FSAP as a  useful and collaborative exercise that  
complements their 2008 Financial Self Assessment. The broad assessment of  financial sector’s stability and deepening since  2001 agreed with that of the Self-Assessment.  The authorities concur that in areas such as  bank resolution, enhancement of lateral bank  supervision and information-sharing, there is  room for improvement, and measures are  already being taken. On the other hand, the  RBI believes that concentration risks can be  adequately addressed through sectoral and  group limits that are already in place, and that  the recent rise in NPAs is transitory and  compares favorably with peer emerging  market economies.  
33. The authorities are also confident  about their strategy for financial  
development. The authorities note that five  companies have requested licenses to open  infrastructure debt funds and that issuance of  tax-free infrastructure bonds has been  facilitated. The authorities also agree that  enhancing borrowing opportunities for SMEs  will require further development of the  corporate bond market, noting that reducing  lock-in periods and allowing the transfer of  bond holding ceilings along with bond sales  should improve liquidity. Several measures  such as monitoring unhedged foreign currency  exposure and limits to underlying exposure of  corporate to derivatives have been taken to  limit corporate risk exposure. Finally, financial  inclusion remains a strong priority and  measures to extend the reach of financial  services are being undertaken through

stimulating private investment. GST reform is  expected to create a unified market across  India, while reorienting spending to  infrastructure and social sectors is critical to  ease supply constraints, make growth more  inclusive, and reduce skill mismatches.  
35. Reducing the deficit would allow  relaxation of financial restrictions currently  employed to ensure the government’s  access to sufficiently low-cost finance.5 The  SLR requires banks to hold 24 percent of  deposits in government or other approved  securities, and pension and insurance funds  are also subject to tight investment guidelines.  This large flow of long-term, low-risk assets

to more productive areas, lowering the cost of  finance for private borrowers, and supporting  growth.  
36. The medium-term FC target is  broadly consistent with a budget deficit  “Golden Rule”. To reach 9 percent growth,  the 12th Plan Approach Paper calls for public  investment of 9-10 percent of GDP, half of  which would need to be spent by the central  and state governments. The FC target of a 5  percent of GDP deficit for the general  government would thus entail government  borrowing almost exclusively for investment  purposes. Over five years, freeing diesel prices  and reforming other subsidies could close  about two-thirds of the gap with the baseline  scenario, while bringing indirect taxes back to  pre-crisis levels would close the rest.  
20 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT 
37. The approval of long-delayed tax  reforms would have positive growth effects.  Both the GST and the new Direct Tax Code  (DTC) are still being negotiated. However, the  central government’s broadening of the base  of indirect taxation to approximate the  eventual GST base and the recent important  agreement on the services list for the GST  show that progress is being made. The FC  estimated that the GST would boost efficiency  by 1½ percent of GDP.  
38. Expenditure reforms, which the  government has repeatedly committed to,  are vital to ensure medium-term fiscal  consolidation. The government is aiming to  boost spending on public investment, health,  and food subsidies, while containing non priority expenditure. Subsidies have been an  important exception to an otherwise relatively  successful containment of non-priority  spending, while slowing growth and rising  expectations for social spending will make  maintaining budget discipline even more  difficult. Liberalization of fuel prices, especially  diesel, and rationalization of fertilizer and gas  subsidies will be crucial to bringing the deficit  down, though support for the most vulnerable  must be ensured. Institutional reforms such as  tighter escape clauses from the Fiscal  Responsibility Act and an independent review  mechanism for fiscal policy, as proposed by  the FC, would help implementation.  Recapitalization of public banks, which  constitute about ¾ of the overall system,  guarantees of public insurance policies, and  India’s growing PPP program, will require more  consistent forecasting of potential government  
outlays (Box 6). Finally, the poor financial  position of several state electricity boards  should be resolved with tariff changes and  improvements in efficiency.  
39. Improving spending efficiency will  be particularly important. India’s Unique  Identification program (UID), already the  world’s largest biometric database, is expected  to cover one-third of the country’s population  – 400 million people – by end-2012. Pilot  projects using the UID to target social benefits  have begun and could represent an important  step in broadening the reach of government  programs at lower cost.  
Authorities’ Views  
40. Fiscal consolidation is well underway  and medium-term targets will be met. The  debt-to-GDP ratio is in within easy reach of the  FC target of 68 percent of GDP by 2014-15.  The authorities note that the deficit  consolidation path is frontloaded, and that  there will be space in the remainder of the FC  period to reach the medium-term target of a  3 percent of GDP budget deficit for the central  government.  
41. The authorities note various  structural measures to improve the  implementation of fiscal policy. The 12th Plan will make improvement of expenditure  efficiency a priority and the UID will pave the  way for direct cash transfers. Bringing down  fuel and fertilizer subsidies is important, but  will have to be done cautiously to minimize  dislocations

BOX 6. ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES FROM PPPS1 
1. India’s increasing use of PPPs for infrastructure creates new liabilities. Private finance for  infrastructure was US$51 billion in 2010/11, or around 2.8 percent of GDP, but the 12th Plan is expected  to call for it to rise to 5 percent of GDP. India’s PPP program, at US$129 billion already one of the world’s  largest, could thus grow rapidly. However, PPPs create contingent liabilities, such as annuities or  termination payments or the need to finish a desired program after an investor goes bankrupt.  
2. These risks should be presented transparently. Some countries, such as the United States,  require contingent liabilities such as public guarantees to be incorporated into the budget; the United  Kingdom also does this with PPPs. Chile annually presents all contingent public liabilities, including PPPs,  calculating both a maximum cost to the government if all guarantees are called (in 2010, around 4  percent of GDP) as well as a probability-based estimate of expected outflow (only around 1/10,000 of  GDP).

3. Estimates for India’s PPP portfolio can also be produced, though data are sparse. We make  simplifying assumptions of project duration and the time remaining on each contract, and also assume  construction liabilities are capped at project cost, while operating income is related to construction cost  and prorated for contracts that can last up to 30 years. Assuming default probabilities approximately  comparable to S&P ratings of BB (for construction) and BBB- (for operation), we find relatively small  exposures. Maximum exposure drops drastically from a peak of around 0.3 percent of GDP as projects  currently under construction come online and reduce potential losses (Figure 1). As for the risk weighted  measure, with 95 percent probability losses remain under Rs 20 billion, or 0.02 percent of GDP. However,  different assumptions could produce different results. More accurate calculations, based on the deeper  database of information available to the authorities, would be worthwhile, especially as these programs  expand.

C. Risks: How Much of a Threat to India are the Advanced Economies’  Troubles? 
42. Risk analysis suggests that India is  vulnerable to a prolonged malaise in  advanced economies. Though India is less  open than most Asian EMs, the confidence  and financial effects of a protracted downturn  in advanced economies could have a sizable  impact on India’s growth (Annex 1). As shown  during the GFC, while India’s consumption is  fairly insulated from global factors and  imports typically compress sharply when a  crisis hits, India’s investment has become  highly correlated with the global cycle. This  suggests that the financial and confidence  channels tend to dominate the trade channel  in the transmission of external shocks.  
Global GDP and Capital Formation (percent year-over-year)
on India amount to 3.2 percent of India’s GDP;  UK banks have 4.2 percent and US banks  3.6 percent. Given foreign banks’ small retail  presence in India, BIS-reporting banks’ claims  on India are mostly cross-border and short  term, exacerbating vulnerabilities. Also,  European banks are important providers of  trade credit and major players in FX  derivatives markets. Global banks so far are

43. Euro zone banks account for about  a third of BIS banks’ claims on India and  their deleveraging could have a material  impact, particularly if global banks are  severely affected. Euro zone banks’ claims  
reducing their claims slowly and are being  replaced by other banks, especially from the  region, though compensating for a sharp and  abrupt deleveraging might not be easy.  Domestic banks, especially public banks which  
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 23 
INDIA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT  
would likely benefit from deposit flight, could  also help replace foreign financing.  
44. External stability risks are currently  manageable but could intensify  
appreciably in a severe global crisis. The  current account deficit is expected to remain  close to its estimated norm of 3 percent of  GDP (Figure 4). Exports have continued to  gain market share, and capital goods account  for the majority of non-oil imports. The real  effective exchange rate (REER) had  
appreciated by 10 percent in 2010 because of  inflation differentials, but with the nominal  depreciation in 2011, the REER is estimated to  be broadly in line with fundamentals. Reserve  coverage is adequate (1.8 times the 2011  gross external financing requirement) and  external debt, which has remained at about 20  percent of GDP, compares well to other major  EMs. But as seen in the second half of 2011,  spikes in global risk aversion lead to a larger  rupee depreciation than for other regional  currencies, because India’s current account  deficit is increasingly financed by external  commercial borrowing and portfolio  
resorted to onshore borrowing, adding to  domestic strains and leading to a spike in  money market rates. Also, many suffered  losses as a result of exchange rate  
depreciation. As India combines low  household incomes with large and  sophisticated firms, bank balance sheets are  dominated by corporate lending, resulting in  high concentration risks, a concern noted in  the FSAP. A significant deterioration in asset  quality could result from a crisis, and public  banks, which have lower levels of capital and  provisioning, could be particularly affected.  
46. If downside risks materialize,  monetary policy can move first, followed  by carefully designed fiscal measures. Monetary policy can provide immediate relief  through liquidity provision, which the RBI has  already started doing in recent months, and  interest rate cuts, especially if the global  shock is accompanied by lower oil prices,  which will reduce inflationary pressures. Fiscal  measures could also help, but should be

GFC. Available fiscal space will depend on  how much progress is made on fiscal  consolidation before a crisis hits. At current  levels of the fiscal deficit and debt, the fiscal  room would be small.  
47. The flexibility of the exchange rate  remains a useful buffer against external  shocks. Since the GFC and until August 2011,  RBI intervention was minimal, and recent  interventions have fallen within the RBI’s  stated policy of intervening only to address  severe market dislocations and foreign  exchange liquidity shortages. Recent  measures by the RBI to restrict banks’ net  foreign exchange (FX) open positions and  corporates’ ability to trade in the onshore  forward market seem to have contributed to  stabilizing the rupee. The authorities have  continued to gradually liberalize capital flows,  such as by freeing interest rates on  nonresident accounts, facilitating the  refinancing of external debt, and allowing  foreign individuals to invest in equities  directly. Consideration could also be given to  increasing the all-in cost spreads on external  commercial borrowing to further ease  external financing constraints.  
Authorities’ Views 
48. The authorities agree that  difficulties in advanced economies pose  serious risks, but underscore India’s  resilience. Both trade and financial channels  could be important in a crisis, though recent  trade diversification should mitigate the  
impact and the main sources of India’s growth  are domestic. The authorities feel the  managed capital account and Indian banks’  minimal exposure to Euro zone assets would  limit financial spillovers. While the recent  depreciation has been comparable to that  experienced during the GFC, high oil prices  have offset the impact on the current account.  
49. While noting that fiscal space is  more constrained than in 2008, the  authorities emphasize that a crisis response  will need to be a coordinated event.  Actions by both the RBI and the government  would be warranted. They also cite reserves as  a line of defense while standing by the  floating exchange rate regime. The RBI  believes FX intervention will remain justified  to smooth volatility or to address severe FX  liquidity shortages. 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 25 
INDIA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT  
STAFF APPRAISAL 
50. India’s growth has slowed due to  cyclical and structural factors. Supply  constraints, rising funding costs, and the  external environment have pulled growth  down below trend in 2011/12, though not yet  sufficiently for sustained disinflation. While still  high relative to other EMs, bringing Indian  growth back to potential and ensuring its  inclusiveness will require continued vigilance  on cyclical policies and a reinvigoration of the  structural agenda.  
51. Growth risks are on the downside. The main domestic risks stem from the pace of  structural reform implementation and  government decision making, and continued  high inflation, while the highly uncertain global  outlook also weighs on investment and  exports.  
52. Given decelerating but still high  inflation, keeping policy rates unchanged  until inflation is clearly on a downward  trend is warranted. Since most of the recent  decline in inflation is due to base effects,  cutting rates immediately would be premature.  Looking beyond March when base effects end,  the RBI should stand ready to raise rates if  sequential inflation rises again, while it could  afford to cut rates if the inflation momentum  clearly eases. Over the medium term, the RBI is  rightly aiming at lowering inflation further to  below 5 percent.  
53. Fiscal policy should stay the course  of medium-term consolidation, resisting  pressures to introduce a demand stimulus. The FC’s medium-term roadmap remains  appropriate. The 2011/12 budget slippage may  entail a more gradual return to the path, but  reconstituting fiscal space is a worthwhile goal  in light of heightened external risks. Fiscal  consolidation would have positive spillover  effects on private sector growth by reducing  the public sector’s absorption of resources and  allowing the existing financial restrictions to be  removed gradually. Fiscal reforms are  preferable to demand stimulus for reviving  investment. In particular, reorienting  expenditure toward capital and social  spending as envisaged by the authorities is  welcome as it can boost investment and  promote inclusive growth. Decontrolling diesel  prices, rationalizing other fuel and fertilizer  subsidies, and moving toward direct cash  transfer under UID are essential to keep  deficits under control and free space for more  growth-enhancing spending. Approval of the  GST should also be a priority. 
54. The revival of growth should come  from structural reforms, rather than from  monetary and fiscal stimulus. Structural  impediments, some of which have intensified  in recent years, are important contributors to  India’s investment slowdown. Removing  obstacles to investment is crucial, especially in 
26 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT 
energy, where a broad range of factors are at  play. Beyond this, passing legislation to  facilitate land acquisition and mining would  promote infrastructure provision and ensure  that India’s high growth potential remains  intact. Financial reforms are needed to increase  corporate and household access to credit and  diversify funding sources. On the other hand,  given the large fiscal deficit and elevated  inflation, fiscal and monetary policy cannot be  relied upon to stimulate investment and  growth.  
55. Such reforms would also make  growth more inclusive. Addressing skill  mismatches, moving toward a more liberalized  labor market, and improving agricultural  productivity will support income growth and  formal job creation, especially for the less  privileged in society.  
56. While India’s financial system is  broadly stable, there is room to guard  against future instability and further  develop markets. Measures to increase and  improve the quality of bank capital are  welcome, along with improving interregulatory  cooperation and clarifying supervisory  responsibilities. On the developmental front,  continuing to develop fixed income markets  will be essential to achieve infrastructure goals,  which in turn will require reducing financial  restrictions over time as fiscal consolidation  progresses. Given concerns about the global  environment, improvements to the resolution  regime, increasing oversight of corporate risks,  
and addressing group concentration risks in  the banking sector are important.  
57. A slowdown in global growth,  particularly if triggered by a sudden stop in  capital flows, would have a serious impact  on India. Investment is increasingly tied to  global cycles, corporates are relatively highly  leveraged, and the external position, while  quite manageable, is less favorable than  during 2008. The resulting growth downturn  could also lead to a substantial deterioration in  asset quality in the financial system.  
58. In the event of a crisis, the flexible  rupee would be an important buffer, while  the scope for fiscal and monetary stimulus  
is more limited than in 2008. The RBI’s  foreign exchange market policies appropriately  limit intervention to extreme situations. The  authorities’ moves toward further gradual  external liberalization are also welcome. In the  event of a crisis, high debt and deficits point to  the need to ensure a prospective fiscal  expansion would be limited and focused on  high-multiplier items such as indirect taxes and  backlogged capital projects. Monetary policy  could be eased, though the extent of easing  will depend on trends in domestic inflation.  
59. It is recommended that the next  Article IV consultation take place on the  standard 12-month cycle.

ANNEX I. THE EFFECTS OF EXTERNAL DOWNSIDE  SCENARIOS ON INDIA1 
1 Prepared by James P. Walsh.  
1. Using a model of 15 large economies,  we assess the effects of a renewed period of  global financial stress and slow global growth  on the Indian economy. The model is a panel  unobserved components model covering 15  major economies that accounts for both trade  and financial linkages, which is particularly  important given likely transmission channels for  India1. The simulation posits a renewed bout of  financial turmoil in the United States and Europe  followed by a protracted period of slow growth.  Rising household savings rates and fiscal  austerity, combined with a weak banking sector  and financial difficulties pull advanced  economies’ growth below potential until 2016.

2. For India and other EMs, this  downside scenario generates a growth shock  comparable to the global financial crisis  (GFC). In the major EMs, the shock to growth  over the first year would be substantial, with  Indian growth declining similarly to what  happens in Brazil and China. Most EMs are not  overheating now to the same degree they were  in 2008, meaning their base rate of growth is  now lower. Under the risk scenario, growth would  thus fall well below potential, and due to  prolonged high risk aversion, to lower levels than  observed during the GFC. Finally, in the long run,  due to the extent and importance of their  financial linkages, Brazil and India show growth  rates still below-pre-crisis levels even toward the  end of the scenario.

India’s Macroeconomic and Financial Linkages 
3. India’s trade would be affected by a  global crisis but the net impact is unlikely to  be large. India is less exposed to global supply  
chain disruptions than many other Asian  economies. While a 1 percent decline in global  domestic demand (weighted by countries’ trade  with India) is associated with a 0.6 percent  decline in Indian exports, this is likely to be  countered by declining imports, as occurred  during the GFC. A $10 fall in global oil prices  would improve India’s current account deficit by  around 0.6 percent of GDP, while falling  investment would pull down imports of capital  goods, which account for about 60 percent of  imports.  
Indian Equities and Global Uncertainty
4. On the other hand, investment would  likely be severely affected. Investment,  particularly corporate investment, has become  increasingly integrated with global trends, both  through sentiment effects and through financial  channels such as corporate external borrowing  and equity markets. Around 11 percent of the  market capitalization, and a significantly larger  share of the free float, of India’s equity markets is  held by foreigners, the stock of external  borrowing by Indian corporates is now around  4 percent of GDP, and total holdings of debt  securities amount to 2.3 percent of GDP. Falling  global investor confidence could thus have a  serious impact on equity prices, the rupee, and  capital flows, complicating rollover of existing  debt or finance for new projects.

5. The corporate sector also presents  some risks. Indian corporates are quite  leveraged, with a debt to equity ratio in 2010 of  248 percent, above comparator countries,  though medium- and long-term debt accounted  for more than 55 percent of total debt, reducing  immediate risks. CDS spreads for Indian  companies have also risen recently, though they  remain below levels seen in 2008/09. Also,  corporates’ rely on foreign sources for around a

quarter of financing, creating the potential for  feedback loops between corporate vulnerabilities  and external shocks.  
6. Bank stress tests run during the FSAP  provide some guidance on how the financial  system would be affected. The FSAP ran stress  
tests based on macroeconomic scenarios  involving global financial stress. In a situation  comparable to the scenario above, banks’ capital  ratios could fall by around a third, and Tier 1  capital to only 2½ percent. NPAs could rise to 7- 8 percent of total advances, a significantly bigger  increase than observed during the GFC.  Capitalization needs could rise to around 3½  percent of total system assets or 1¾ percent of  GDP. At the same time, global uncertainty would

complicate dollar borrowing by banks and  corporates and could, as in 2008/09, lead to a

domestic liquidity crunch, though not one  beyond the ability of the RBI to manage through  its steadily improving liquidity framework.  
7. India’s external position has also  weakened somewhat since the GFC. The net  international investment position fell from - 6 percent of GDP in March 2008 to -13 percent  of GDP in September 2011. Short-term external  debt rose from 27.2 to 39.7 percent of reserves  
percent of GDP and its duration has remained  broadly stable since the GFC, though forecast  debt service over the next two years is higher  
than during the run-up to the GFC, particularly  when compared to a relatively constant stock of  international reserves.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:  
As per the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), the  exchange rate in India is classified as floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined in the  interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes at times. The RBI’s role is to  modulate excessive volatility so as to maintain orderly conditions. On August 20, 1994, India  accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement. India  maintains the following restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current

ANNEX II. INDIA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD  BANK GROUP 
In Bank FY2011 (July 1-June 30), IBRD/IDA  lending totaled US$3.47 billion. IFC committed  $754 million in FY2011. The World Bank Group’s  (WBG) Country Strategy (CAS) for India for 2009- 2012 focuses on helping India to fast-track the  development of much-needed infrastructure and  to support the seven poorest states in achieving  higher standards of living for their people. The  strategy envisaged a total proposed International  Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)  lending program of US$14.6 billion for the four year CAS period, of which approximately US$3  billion additional IBRD financing was in response  to the financial crisis. The International  Development Association (IDA) 15 allocation was  SDR 2.919 billion (US$ equivalent 4.79 billion).  Midway through CAS implementation the  projected IBRD lending was revised upward to  US$16 billion. India’s IDA 16 allocation is SDR  3,243.6 billion US$ equivalent 5.019 billion).  
As a result of the financial crisis as well as  increased Government demand for the Bank  Group’s support, the pace of IBRD lending  accelerated in FY10-11, bringing India closer to  its Single Borrower Limit (SBL) of $17.5 billion  earlier than anticipated. To help maintain India’s  IBRD net exposure within the SBL and ensure  medium-term sustainability of the India program,  the Reserve Bank of India is discussing an  agreement with the IBRD and the Bank for  International Settlements on purchases of IBRD  Special Private Placement Bonds. The IBRD and  Government are working to increasing the  selectivity of new projects and scaling up efforts  to leverage private finance with IBRD  
investments. India is IFC’s largest country  exposure. IFC is focusing on projects with  development impact and is managing its  exposure via mobilization and selectivity.  
The overarching objective of the CAS is to scale  up the development impact of Bank Group  assistance to help India achieve: rapid, inclusive  growth; sustainable development; and improve  service delivery. It aims to do all this while  strengthening project implementation, improving  the effectiveness of public spending, and  achieving demonstrable results to scale up the  impact of World Bank assistance. The diversity of  India calls for a differentiated, tailored approach.  In India’s low-income states and lagging regions  in more advanced states, the focus is on  achieving the MDGs, relying primarily on IDA  resources and non-lending technical assistance  (TA). In more advanced states and at the central  level, the focus is on strengthening institutions so  that they can deal with emerging middle income  challenges, relying on IBRD lending and cutting edge analytical work. In the context of WBG India  CAS, IFC’s three strategic pillars are inclusive  growth, climate change and regional and global  integration. IFC is prioritizing support for the  Low Income and North East States in order to  better promote inclusive growth.  
The World Bank’s India Program is increasingly  focused on supporting large, transformative  development programs, with projects such as the  National Ganga River Basin, Pradhan Mantri  Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) Second Rural  Roads, and National Rural Livelihoods, and  innovative operations such as the Karnataka  Watershed. The shift to a more substantial  engagement has raised the visibility and  influence of the Bank Group, while creating  opportunities for greater focus on public policy  and institutional reform.

ANNEX III. INDIA—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN  DEVELOPMENT BANK 
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) operations in  India began in 1986. Cumulative public sector loan  commitments totaled $25.3 billion as of 31 December  2011 for 159 loans. With an additional $1.9 billion in  private sector loans (the latter without government  guarantee), total loan commitments on a cumulative  
basis amount to $27.2 billion. These funds have been  provided from AsDB’s ordinary capital resources  (OCR). Also, AsDB has approved equity investments  amounting to $0.3 billion. AsDB’s lending and equity  activities are summarized below.

AsDB's India Country Partnership Strategy (2009- 2012) (CPS) is based on four strategic pillars: (i)  Support for the process of inclusive and  
environmentally sustainable growth; (ii) Catalyzing  investment through the use of innovative business  and financing modalities; (iii) Strengthening the  results orientation of project design and  
implementation and emphasizing knowledge  solutions; and (iv) Support for regional cooperation.  The CPS has been designed to support Government  of India's efforts in facilitating inclusive growth and  speeding up the pace of poverty reduction and social  development as emphasized in the Eleventh Five-Year  
Plan (2007-2012). It has been prepared within a  results-based framework, and aims at significantly  strengthening AsDB support for infrastructure  development in the relatively poorer states of India,  promoting public private partnerships in  infrastructure, supporting climate change adaptation  and mitigation, and encouraging the use of  innovative financing modalities (non-sovereign loans  and cofinancing) to enhance the leverage of AsDB  operations.

INDIA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX  
ANNEX IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES  
1. Macroeconomic statistics are adequate  for surveillance, but weaknesses remain in the  timeliness and coverage of certain statistical  series. India has an intricate system for  compiling economic and financial statistics and  produces a vast quantity of data covering most  sectors of the economy. India subscribed to the  Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) on  December 27, 1996 and started posting its  metadata on the Dissemination Standards  Bulletin Board on October 30, 1997. It is  currently in observance of the SDDS, although it  uses flexibility options for timeliness of data on  general government operations and on the  periodicity and timeliness of labor market data.  
2. The data module of the Report on  Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, IMF  Country Report No. 04/96) was published  in April 2004. It assesses India’s data  
dissemination practices against the SDDS  requirements and assesses the quality of six  datasets based on the Data Quality Assessment  Framework (DQAF) developed by STA.  
3. National accounts and employment  statistics: The Central Statistical Organization  (CSO) releases a new series of national accounts,  with base year 2004–2005 with a dissemination  lag for quarterly releases of two months.  Estimates of value added in constant prices for  
public administration and defense may be  biased upwards, as they are based on the  government’s wage bill (with arrears counted in  the year that they are paid) deflated by the  Wholesale Price Index (WPI). There are long  standing deficiencies in employment data: they  are only available on an annual basis and with a  substantial lag, and they only cover the formal  sector, which accounts for a small segment of  the labor market.  
4. Price statistics: Since January 2006, the  Labour Bureau has published a CPI for industrial  workers with a 2001 base year. A revised CPI  with new weights was unveiled in early 2011.  Presently, there are four CPIs, each based on the  consumption basket of a narrow category of  consumers (namely industrial workers, urban  and nonmanual employees, agricultural laborers,  and rural laborers). The CPIs are published with  a lag of about one month. With the exception of  the industrial workers CPI, the other indices are  based on weights that are over ten years. The  WPI was also recently revised and has a 2004/05  base year. Despite recent progress, real estate  and housing price data are not available on a  timely basis and the geographic coverage  remains limited.  
5. External sector statistics: While the  concepts and definitions used to compile 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7 
INDIA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX  
balance of payments statistics are broadly in line  with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments  Manual (BPM5), the RBI presentation does not  strictly follow the BPM5. Furthermore, trade data  have quality, valuation, timing, and coverage  problems, and data on trade prices, volumes,  and composition are not regularly available on a  timely basis. Only trade credit extended for  more than 180 days is included in the balance of  payments (and the IIP and external debt data);  trade credit is often less than 180 days in most  countries. Bilateral data on services exports to  the United States and other developed countries  are manifold higher than counterpart services  imports published by these same countries.  External debt statistics are available on a  quarterly basis with a one quarter lag. Estimates  of short-term external debt are presented in the  debt statistics on an original maturity basis. The  short-term maturity attribution on a residual  maturity basis is only available annually (and  excludes residual maturity of medium- and  long-term nonresident Indian accounts). The  international investment position (IIP) statistics  cover the sectors prescribed in the BPM5 and  these data are disseminated within six months  of the reference period in respect of annual  data. Coverage of direct investment positions  data is hampered by the absence of appropriate  legal or institutional authority. India began  disseminating the Data Template on  
International Reserves and Foreign Currency  
Liquidity as prescribed under the SDDS in  December 2001. The more up-to-date  information on certain variables, such as total  foreign reserves, foreign currency assets, gold,  and SDRs, are available on a weekly basis and  are disseminated as part of a weekly statistical  supplement on the RBI web site.  
6. Monetary and financial statistics: The  RBI web site and the RBI Bulletin publish a wide  array of monetary and financial statistics,  including reserve money and its components,  RBI’s survey, monetary survey, liquidity  aggregates (outstanding amounts), interest  rates, exchange rates, foreign reserves, and  results of government securities auctions. The  frequency and quality of data dissemination  have improved substantially in recent years.  
7. Concepts and definitions used by the  RBI to compile monetary statistics are in broad  conformity with the guidelines provided in the  Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual  (MFSM). Nevertheless, the following concepts  and principles deviate from the MFSM. First, the  resident sector data do not provide sufficient  information on the sectoral distribution of  domestic credit. Specifically, under their present  sectorization scheme, the authorities subdivide  the resident nonbank sector data by (i) central  government; (ii) state government; and (iii) the  commercial sector (including other financial  corporations, public and other nonfinancial 
8 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
INDIA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX  
corporations, and other resident sectors).  Second, commercial banks add accrued interest  to credit and deposit positions on a quarterly  basis only (instead of the prescribed monthly  basis).  
8. The RBI reports monetary data for IFS on  a regular basis. Since October 2006, the RBI has  initiated the electronic reporting of monetary  data, which is a major improvement from the  previous paper-based reporting which was  prone to errors and delays. India has also  submitted to STA test data (starting from  December 2001 data) on the Standardized  Report Forms (SRFs) that have been developed  to implement the methodology outlined in the  MFSM. STA is working with the authorities in  resolving the outstanding data issues on the  development of the SRFs.  
9. Government finance statistics: The  Ministry of Finance (MoF) is responsible for  compiling and disseminating the GFS. India  reports the budgetary central government cash  flow statement within one month after the  reference month and stock of liabilities within  one quarter after the reference quarter. With the  agreement of the authorities, STA uses these  data to compile a monthly cash flow statement  for publication in the International Financial  Statistics, following the GFSM 2001 presentation,  
with some missing breakdowns, particularly for  expenditure. T However, no monthly data on  fiscal performance at the state level are  available. Data on the functional and economic  classification of expenditures are available with  considerable lag. There is also scope to improve  the analytical usefulness of the presentation of  the fiscal accounts. For example, classification of  government expenditure between  
developmental/nondevelopmental and  plan/nonplan obscures the economic nature and  impact of fiscal actions. The MoF reports central  government data (on a cash basis) for  publication in the Government Finance Statistics  Yearbook (GFSY), the latest reported data  corresponding to 2010. Two years after the  reference year, the Ministry of Finance reports  general government data to STA in the GFSM  1986 format, that staff reworks to the GFSM  2001 presentation for inclusion in the GFSY  (latest reported data correspond to 2008). Data  on the general government operations are not  internationally comparable as they exclude data  on the operations of the extra-budgetary funds,  local governments, and social security funds.  Under the SDDS, India disseminates annual  general government data within 3 quarters after  the reference year, using the timeliness flexibility  option but meets the SDDS specifications for  central government debt and operations.

INDIA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS  
ANNEX I. INDIA: MEDIUM-TERM SUSTAINABILITY  ANALYSIS 
Macroeconomic Assumptions. Growth is  forecast at 7 percent in 2012/13, and is  expected to revert only gradually to trend  growth of around 7½ - 8 percent in the  medium term. Inflation (WPI) is expected to be  around 7 percent in the year to March 2012,  but with little decline expected thereafter.  
Fiscal Assumptions. The rapid consolidation  called for in early 2010 has proved challenging.  The 2011/12 general government deficit is  forecast at 8.1 percent of GDP. While state  budget deficits are largely contained, deficits  at the central level are likely to decline only  slowly.  
· Tax revenues remain well below historical  levels of GDP due to slowing corporate  revenues, cuts to fuel taxes, and a failure to  reverse the 2009 tax cuts taken to  
stimulate the economy. Buoyancy has been  modest since the end of the global  
financial crisis (GFC); combined with the  clouded outlook for tax reform,  
consolidation based on revenue is  
unlikely1.  
· Expenditure in three of the four areas  targeted by the government for  
consolidation (interest, wages and  
pensions), as well as military and Plan  expenditure, are expected to remain under  control and support consolidation.  
· The fourth area, subsidies, continues to  grow rapidly. Reforms to fertilizer pricing  have not brought down subsidy payments,  and diesel prices are now around one-third  
1 The DTC and GST have both been delayed, but in any case  are likely to be revenue neutral in the near term.  
percent below international prices as they  were raised only once in the first 11  months of 2011/12. Without significant  reform this will continue to weigh on the  budget.  
A. Sensitivity Analysis  
Debt Path under the baseline. The  primary deficit is expected to remain  around 3 percent over the medium term,  slightly below the debt-stabilizing level as  interest rates remain well below GDP  growth. The ratio of debt to GDP is thus  likely to decline steadily from 66¼ percent  at end-2011/12 to 61.4 percent in 2017/18.  
Other Scenarios. With deficits close to the  debt-stabilizing level, a scenario of no  policy change produces constant  dynamics. Nominal GDP growth averaging  around 14 percent reduces the impact of  most shocks, so shocks to interest rates or  contingent liabilities would have only a  transient effect on debt dynamics, though  one with slower growth would produce a  slowly rising debt ratio.  
Policy Risks. A return to fiscal  
consolidation involving serious subsidy  reform would bring India closer to last  year’s analysis of a more rapid decline in  the debt ratio. On the other hand, a big  increase in spending in the buildup to the  12th Plan or a large stimulus to revive a  slowing economy could produce  significantly less favorable dynamics.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks. Figures in the  boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented. Ten-year  historical average for the variable is also shown. 
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance. 3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2009, with real  depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic  inflation (based on GDP deflator).

6 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on India  
March 9, 2012  
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report was  circulated to the Executive Board. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff  appraisal.  
Economic and financial developments  
1. The latest national accounts data confirmed the broad based slowdown, but  there are signs of a modest rebound. GDP growth dropped to 6.1 percent y/y in 2011Q4  (6.8 percent in 2011 Q3), in line with staff projections. Investment remains sluggish with a  third consecutive decline in y/y terms. Private consumption was robust at 6.4 percent y/y.  From the supply side, the slowdown was mostly due to manufacturing (which grew by  0.8 percent y/y, versus 2.7 percent in the previous quarter), while services continued to  advance at a robust pace. In sequential terms, however, activity seems to have bottomed out.  After rebounding strongly since late 2011, the manufacturing and services PMIs stabilized in  February and remained well above the expansionary threshold.  
2. The trade deficit rose to $14.8 billion in January (compared with $10.3 billion in  the previous year), owing to the jump in imports. Import growth reached 20.3 percent y/y,  partly due to higher oil prices, while non-oil imports growth moderated to 17.6 percent.  Exports have also picked up steam, advancing by 10.1 percent y/y, following single digit  growth in late 2011.  
3. In line with staff projections, inflation pressures have continued to abate on base  effects. The new national CPI (which was introduced last year) recorded an inflation rate of  7.7 percent y/y, while consumer price inflation for industrial workers fell sharply to  5.3 percent y/y due to the retrenchment in food prices. In sequential terms, the CPI-IW  inflation momentum has also moderated.  
4. The rupee has appreciated and capital inflows have returned in recent weeks.  The rupee has appreciated by 8 percent against the U.S. dollar so far this year, with the  NEER appreciating by about 5 percent. Portfolio equity inflows (mutual funds and ETFs)  have rebounded significantly since late January. 
Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 12/36  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
April 17, 2012  
International Monetary Fund  700 19th Street, NW  
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA 
IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with India  
On March 9, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the  2012 Article IV consultation with India.1 
Background  
India’s growth remains one of the highest in the world, but a range of factors have weighed it  down. Following a rapid recovery after the global financial crisis, the economy has slowed more  than most other major emerging markets, as investment has been dampened by a confluence  of cyclical and global factors, as well as by concerns about structural impediments.  Consumption, particularly in rural areas, and exports, with increasing geographical destination  diversity and sophistication, have been the bright spots. At the same time, inflation is elevated,  and its recent moderation is primarily due to base effects. While monetary policy has been  tightened, the fiscal deficit remains high. The unsettled global outlook has added to policy  challenges. After the boom in capital inflows in 2010/11, rising global risk aversion has reduced  the flow of capital. The rupee depreciated the most among major Asian currencies in 2011,  partly due to India’s current account deficit. Concerns about global growth have harmed investor  sentiment and advanced economies’ bank deleveraging has raised the cost of external finance.  
Growth is projected at about 7 percent for 2011/12 and 2012/13, with inflation forecast to remain  above the RBI’s comfort zone. Investment is anticipated to pick up modestly from the slump  recorded in late 2011, and consumption should remain robust, but exports are expected to cool.    
1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with  members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial  information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On  return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the  Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the  Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the  country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:  http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.  
2 
Inflation is projected to fall in the near term, but to stay above the Reserve Bank of India’s  objective. The current account is projected at 2.8 percent of GDP.  
Growth risks are to the downside. The main domestic risk is a further weakening of private  investment if government approvals do not accelerate, reform efforts are not reinvigorated, and  inflation remains high and volatile. At the same time, external risks continue to be elevated as  Euro area growth could underperform and bank deleveraging could intensify even in the  absence of a new full-fledged global financial crisis. Inflation risks remain, as momentum  indicators are mixed.  
Executive Board Assessment  
Executive Directors noted that sound macroeconomic policies and fundamentals enabled India  to weather well the global economic crisis. Nevertheless, economic growth has slowed below  trend in the last year due to cyclical and structural factors, and while inflation has come down, it  is still high. Some Directors noted that it is difficult to attribute the current slowdown to structural  factors. Downside risks prevail in light of the uncertain global environment, supply constraints  and elevated funding costs. A major challenge will be to bring growth back to potential and  ensure its inclusiveness, while further lowering inflation. Directors underscored that this will  require a reinvigoration of structural reforms and fiscal consolidation.  
Directors encouraged continued vigilance against inflation. They agreed that policy rates should  be kept unchanged until inflation is clearly on a downward trend, given the uncertain outlook for  growth. They encouraged the Reserve Bank of India to stand ready to raise policy rates if  inflation starts to rise again, while it could consider cutting rates if the inflation momentum  clearly eases.  
Directors stressed that fiscal consolidation is crucial to crowd in private investment and lower  inflationary expectations. They supported the planned reorientation of expenditure toward  infrastructure and the social sectors, and highlighted the need to rationalize fuel and fertilizer  subsidies and improve public expenditure management. They encouraged tax reform,  especially the introduction of the goods and services tax.  
Directors considered the flexible exchange rate regime to be an important buffer against  external shocks, and supported the policy of intervening in the foreign exchange market only to  contain volatility and to prevent disruptive movements. They welcomed the authorities’ moves  toward further trade and gradual capital account liberalization.  
Directors underscored the importance of structural reform to raise public and private investment  and boost inclusive growth. While some progress has been made, many Directors were of the  view that a more determined effort to remove structural impediments is required in several  areas. On the other hand, some Directors felt that structural reforms were progressing at a  measured pace. Continuing to develop infrastructure, which in turn requires facilitating land  acquisition and mining, would ensure that India’s growth potential remains intact. Financial

sector development and reform are needed to improve access to credit and diversify funding  sources. Addressing skill mismatches, increasing labor market flexibility, and improving  agricultural productivity are crucial to support formal job creation and reduce poverty.  
Directors welcomed the FSSA’s finding that India’s financial system is broadly stable, albeit with  room for improvement in the regulatory and supervisory framework, and encouraged  development of a prioritized action plan to implement key recommended reforms. They  welcomed measures to increase the quantity and quality of bank capital, strengthen  inter-regulatory cooperation, and clarify supervisory responsibilities. They encouraged close  monitoring of asset quality and provisioning; continued development of domestic bond markets;  a gradual reduction of credit concentration limits, with due regard to development needs for  financing, and a reduction in mandatory holdings of government securities by financial  institutions, while ensuring adequate liquidity buffers for financial stability.

Statement by Arvind Virmani, Executive Director for India  
and Michael Patra, Senior Advisor  
March 9, 2012  
1. We welcome staff’s candid assessment of recent macroeconomic and financial  developments in India and the evolving outlook, based as it has been on constructive and  open-minded engagement by our authorities during 2011 and early 2012. This year’s Article  IV consultation assumes added importance in view of the high uncertainty characterizing the  global environment, which is impacting India’s macroeconomic performance and prospects  on a persisting basis. This consultation is also noteworthy for it being co-terminus with the  Financial Sector Assessment Program. While there is broad consistency between staff’s  analysis and the assessment of our authorities in several aspects, there are also some areas of  divergence which we address in this statement.  
Recent Macroeconomic Developments  
2. It is heartening to note staff’s impatience with the under-actualization of India’s  growth potential - in ascribing the recent slowdown to ‘governance scandals’ and ‘civil  activism’, aspects in the life and ethos of every open, secular and pluralistic democracy the  world over, as currently being witnessed, but inevitably subservient to the rule of law, as  demonstrated in India. To draw casual connections between these events and the slowing of  the economy is speculative and runs the risk of missing more fundamental factors at work. It  is necessary to recognise that the slowdown is common to all major economies that  experienced a robust rebound from the crisis of 2008-09; however, a careful analysis of high  frequency data may indicate that the Indian economy has been undergoing a cyclical  moderation that set in during the second half of 2010-11 (April-March), again a phenomenon  recorded across the world. Lead indicators – capacity utilisation; new investment intentions;  sales growth; order books; business confidence – are all exhibiting cyclical effects.    
3. Additionally, two factors have accentuated the downturn. First, the worsening  external environment is strongly impacting demand – as staff has correctly noted, India’s  investment, which is the main driver of the current downturn, has become closely correlated  with the global cycle (page 23). In particular, corporate investment in manufacturing and  tradeables shows close co-movement with global demand. Our estimates show that a one  percentage point decline in global growth could result in 0.3 percentage points decline in the  growth of non-agricultural domestic demand. Furthermore, one percentage point decline in  India’s gross fixed capital formation could shave off about 0.2 percentage points from  potential output growth.  
4. Secondly, the anti-inflationary monetary policy stance has had a dampening effect on  investment demand as well as on interest-sensitive components of private consumption, as  was expected in view of the objective of lowering inflation. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)  has raised its policy rates on 13 occasions since March 2010 amounting to an increase of 350  basis points – the most aggressive central bank response to inflation in recent times. Inflation  has moderated significantly since January 2012. 
 2  
5. Lead indicators are now suggesting that the economy is reaching the bottom of the  cycle. In January 2012, purchasing managers indices for India reached their highest level  since April 2011, led by forward-looking indicators of output and new orders. The PMIs have  continued to remain in expansionary mode in February 2012, albeit with a slight moderation  in output growth. The February 2012 OECD composite leading indicator for India points to  an upward positive change in momentum. While private consumption has been resilient, a  durable easing trend in core inflation will boost consumer confidence significantly. Exports  have expanded by 26 percent in the financial year up to December 2011, outpaced by import  growth. As capital flows turned volatile, there was a drawdown of reserves to finance the  rising current account deficit. In retrospect, it was the arsenal of policy instruments available  and the measured approach to capital account management that restored stability and enabled  a modest real appreciation in the early months of 2012. Our authorities are fully cognisant  that a large and/or prolonged external shock could easily overwhelm these efforts and cloud  the outlook.  
The Quality of Growth  
6. In evaluating the performance of the Indian economy and the road ahead, it is perhaps  useful to step back and take a longer-term perspective. Over the period 2007-12 (April March), average GDP growth of around 8.2 per cent, as against 7.8 percent in the preceding  five-year period, was achieved in a difficult international environment. This implies a 35 per  cent increase in per capita GDP during 2007-12. The progress towards inclusiveness is  difficult to assess, because inclusiveness is a multidimensional concept. Yet some progress  has been achieved. Illustratively, preliminary estimates suggest that poverty declined by  approximately one percentage point per annum during the five-year period 2004-05 to 2009- 10, faster than before. India is well poised to meet the Millennium Development Goal target  of 50 per cent reduction of poverty between 1990 and 2015. The National Rural Employment  Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), with a people-centered, demand-driven architecture, has  directly led to the creation of 9.9 billion person-days of work since its inception in 2006-07.  In 2010-11 alone, the MGNREGA generated employment to the tune of 2.53 billion person days. It has also successfully raised the bargaining power of agricultural labour resulting in  higher agricultural wages, reduction in distress migration and has also secured some  inclusivity in the growth process. The progress achieved so far may be modest relative to  aspirations, but an important consequence of the intensified focus on inclusion has been  heightened awareness and empowerment, greater desire to access information about rights  and entitlements, and eagerness to demand accountability from the public delivery systems.  
Outlook  
7. Over the next five years (2012-17), our authorities are putting in place a growth  strategy that envisages a return to our estimate of potential output growth of 8.5 to 9 percent.  In this regard, we differ from staff’s estimates of potential growth which seem to vary  annually and are sensitive to choice of methodology, in contrast to our view that potential  growth is a medium- to longer-term concept that reflects underlying structural trends rather  than cyclical variations and year-to-year shifts and events. What shall be the drivers of this  return to trajectory? First, the high rates of investment and private sector savings constitute  strong macro-economic fundamentals supporting high growth. Secondly, with India’s young  population, the labour force is expected to increase by 32 per cent over the next 20 years and 
 3  
add to the growth potential. Thirdly, the thrust on accelerating the pace of investment in the  physical infrastructure will be sustained. Since more than two-thirds of the investment in the  economy is by the private sector, public-private partnership-(PPP)-based efforts, already one  of the largest in the world, are expected to constitute 50 per cent of the estimated investment  in infrastructure of about 10.0 per cent of GDP by 2016-17, up from 30.0 per cent currently.  
Measures are being taken to enhance private sector funding of infrastructure. The  establishment of infrastructure debt funds is a step in this direction. The creation of a vibrant  and liquid corporate bond market is being taken up on a priority basis. Fourthly, Indian  companies in many sectors have shown capacity for innovation, which needs to be nurtured  and strengthened through a greatly expanded programme of Research & Development  (R&D). Fifthly, constraints arising from the supply side, such as better availability of water,  power and land-based resources will be the focus of the growth strategy for the medium term.  
Monetary Policy Issues  
8. An issue that has vexed our authorities is staff persisting in stating that “the RBI  could give more weight to the CPI in policy formulation over WPI” (paragraph 16)  repetitively in successive Article IV Consultation reports. As a comprehensive CPI did not  exist till January 2011 this appears disingenuous. CPIs continue to be dominated by food  items, and the efficacy of monetary policy to deal with food inflation is limited.  Accordingly, in the Indian context, the conduct and formulation of monetary policy cannot  be guided solely by CPI movements. The RBI therefore follows a multiple indicator  approach to the monitoring of inflation, closely monitoring and analyzing movements in the  three available sectional CPIs (CPI for industrial workers; CPI for agricultural labourers; CPI  for rural labourers). The RBI communicates its forecasts in terms of the WPI simply because  the CPIs relate to specific sections of the population whereas the WPI is a national-level  index (and the RBI is a national - not sectoral- or section-level- institution). This is not a  phenomenon peculiar to India. Illustratively, in the USA, inflation is measured by the CPI,  but the Federal Reserve prefers to communicate its view of inflation in terms of the personal  consumption expenditure deflator. This by no means implies that more weight or less weight  is given to one indicator over another in the analysis of inflation. Now that a new  comprehensive CPI has been developed, it is bound to play a greater role once it has an  established track record. Given the wide diversity of the Indian population and variations in  consumption baskets, it has been found necessary to compile CPIs for the rural and urban  population to measure inflation. The latter indices are being compiled since January 2011,  and so far only twelve observations are available. The fact that national-level CPIs are being  compiled is indicative of the intention of our authorities, but they would wait for enough  observations to be convinced that the new CPIs have stabilized, that they truly reflect  inflation conditions and that they are well understood by the public.  
Fiscal Policy  
9. With tax revenues affected by the cyclical downturn in growth, and expenditures  overshooting mainly on account of the impact of the significantly higher than budgeted  global prices of crude and fertilizer, restraining the fiscal deficit in 2011-12 to the targeted  path of consolidation is proving to be a major challenge. The final outcome will be known on  March 16, 2012 when the Union Budget for 2012-13 will be presented to the Parliament. 
 4  
Accordingly, it is premature to speculate on the actual outcome at this juncture (as in  paragraph 9 of the staff report). The trajectory of deficit adjustment continues to be  downward; in terms of averages for the years 2010-11 and 2011-12 rather than for each year  in isolation, fiscal consolidation remains on track. The public debt/GDP ratio at 67 percent at  the end of 2010-11, according to the September 2011 WEO, is already very close to the  target of 68 percent set for 2014-15.  
Financial Sector Issues  
10. Our authorities welcome the comprehensive review of India’s financial sector and the  quality of regulation and supervision in India under the FSAP. They regard this engagement  as extensive and productive. Although there are some differences of views, they fully  recognize the importance of the FSAP in contributing to financial stability in India and  express strong support for the role FSAP plays in promoting the soundness of the global  financial system. India remains committed to phased adoption of international standards and  best practices calibrated to suit our local conditions to meet the developmental and inclusion  goals as well as to maintain stability in the financial system.  
11. We will restrict our comments to our key concerns relating to some of the findings/  recommendations in the FSSA. First, while the level of non-performing assets at 2.8 percent  of total assets in the banking system has shown a modest increase in 2011, it compares  favourably with asset impairment levels in both major advanced economies and peer  economies. Secondly, with regard to the issue of large exposure limits, this is driven by the  development needs of the country, especially in the context of the need to finance investment  in infrastructure. Tightening the concentration limits would severely constrain the availability  of bank finance, which is the major source of finance for this purpose. Thirdly, while the  FSAP report recognizes the benefit of the cash reserve ratio (CRR)/statutory liquidity ratio  (SLR) in providing liquidity to banks in crisis time, it neglects the financial stability  enhancing role played by them – the large pool of liquid assets comprising the highest quality  collateral which helped Indian banks to deal with the tightening of liquidity during the global  financial crisis of 2008-09, and which places them in an advantageous position with respect  to compliance with Basel III norms. Furthermore, staff’s argument that mandatory holdings  weaken monetary transmission is not clear as government market borrowings are at market determined interest rates and monetary policy actions impact such yields. Moreover, banks  voluntarily hold higher than mandated levels of these securities. Fourthly, several steps have  been taken to improve oversight over interconnectedness and financial conglomerates  including (i) prudential limits on aggregate interbank liabilities; (ii) restricting  uncollateralised funding to banks and primary dealers with caps on both lending and  borrowing by these entities; (iii) restrictions on capital instruments of banks; (iv) restrictions  on banks’ exposure to non-bank financial companies (NBFCs), and tighter regulation of  NBFCs; and (v) intensive monitoring of financial conglomerates and common exposures in  sensitive sectors. Our authorities also fully recognize the importance of establishing  information sharing arrangements with other jurisdictions and are expanding appropriate  information sharing networks on a priority basis. There are substantial developments in the  areas of home-host relationships as well as engagement with supervisors in other  jurisdictions on an ongoing basis.  
 5  
Conclusion  
12. The macroeconomic fundamentals of the Indian economy are strong and resilient.  Over the past two years, the challenges of inflation and fiscal consolidation have necessitated  a focus on demand management. It is now time to address supply side issues. The  productivity and innovation enhancing elements in the New Manufacturing Policy and the  National Skill Development Mission, along with intensified efforts to bridge the gaps in  physical and social infrastructure, are intended to release the supply constraints and allow  India to renew its tryst with faster, sustainable and more inclusive growth, the theme of our  approach to the Twelfth Five Year Plan covering the period 2012-17.

Prepared by 21Bthe Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with India  Approved by Masahiko Takeda and Tamim Bayoumi  
25BDDecember 6, 2010 
· Mission. A staff team consisting of M. Takeda (head), L. Papi, R. Guimarães,  J.P. Walsh (all APD), X. Wu (MCM), and S. Panth (Senior Resident Representative)  visited Delhi, Hyderabad, and Mumbai from November 1 to 17, 2010. Messrs. Virmani  and Patra (OED) joined the mission.  
· Outlook and risks. India’s growth outlook is favorable both in the near and medium  term, as domestic demand drivers remain strong: investment, especially in  infrastructure, is rising rapidly and consumption is buoyed by rising rural incomes and  urbanization trends. Risks stem mainly from weaker global growth.  
· Key policy issues. The main near-term policy issue is elevated inflation. Achieving the  government’s medium-term fiscal consolidation targets while increasing infrastructure  and social spending will be challenging. A range of reforms are needed, including in  the financial area, to achieve the authorities’ ambitious goals in infrastructure.  
· Past advice. In the last consultation, the authorities broadly agreed with the Fund’s  advice that India’s vigorous recovery required an earlier exit from the stimulus  implemented during the crisis than most other countries. They also concurred on the  policy priorities over the longer term, chiefly fiscal consolidation and financial sector  reforms. 
· Exchange rate regime. Floating. India is an Article VIII country, but maintains  restrictions subject to approval under Article VIII: these restrictions have not been  approved by the Executive Board.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Context: India’s economy has recovered from the crisis and is performing well, but inflation  remains elevated. Robust domestic demand combined with weak growth in advanced  countries is widening the current account deficit. Risks to growth are broadly balanced, with  downside risks relating mainly to the global economy. Capital inflows so far are manageable,  but could complicate macroeconomic management. The medium-term outlook is favorable,  with growth expected to be underpinned by high investment and productivity gains.  
Policy messages:  
· Robust growth and elevated inflation warrant prompt action in completing the  normalization of the monetary and fiscal stance.  
· Further monetary tightening is needed to meet the RBI’s inflation objectives and  anchor inflation expectations.  
· The government’s renewed commitment to fiscal consolidation is welcome. Not only  would tighter fiscal policy be the best way of cooling the economy, but this year’s  receipts overperformance offers an opportunity to reconstitute fiscal space faster.  
· Spending reforms will be critical to square the consolidation objectives with the need  for higher infrastructure and social spending. Implementing the tax reforms in the  works could also contribute.  
· The authorities are rightly monitoring the current account deficit, as the potential  impact of a reversal in capital inflows has risen.  
· India’s flexible exchange rate serves the country well in managing capital inflows. If  inflows become excessive, a wide array of tools could be used.  
· Efforts to facilitate infrastructure investment, especially measures to deepen the  corporate bond market, are bearing fruit and will need to be sustained to meet the  authorities’ ambitious goals in this area.

I. Context: Rapid Growth and Elevated Inflation  
1. India’s growth remains among the highest in the world. Since mid-2009 the pace  of India’s recovery—led by domestic demand, especially infrastructure investment—has  been strong. Real GDP in Q3 2010 grew at 8.9 percent y/y, with consumption advancing  rapidly as well (Figure 1). With little or no slack in the economy, an incomplete exit from the  policy stimulus introduced during the crisis, and structural factors affecting food prices,  inflation is in the 8½ to 10½ percent range.

2. The combination of robust domestic demand in India with weak growth and  accommodative policies in advanced economies is widening the current account deficit  and boosting capital inflows. Import growth has outpaced the brisk export expansion  (Figure 2). Capital inflows have offset the current account deficit so that the nominal  effective exchange rate has appreciated only slightly. Unlike several countries in the region,  the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has barely intervened since November 2009.  
3. The government is focused on high and inclusive growth, with economic reforms  progressing slowly. While India has made substantial progress toward achieving the  Millennium Development Goals, weaknesses remain in some areas, particularly poverty and  malnutrition. The government is pursuing inclusiveness by targeting poverty reduction and  several social indicators. Two broad pillars underpin these goals: expanding social programs  and a big push for infrastructure development. Other reforms—e.g. concerning taxes,  financial legislation, and land acquisition—have been delayed.  
4. Real GDP growth is projected to be above trend at 8¾ percent in 2010/11, with  risks broadly balanced. Infrastructure is likely to remain an important growth driver, and  corporate investment is expected to rise as capacity constraints are emerging and funding  conditions are conducive. Private consumption should contribute substantially, benefiting  from a good harvest after last year’s drought as well as urbanization trends. Downside risks  to growth stem primarily from weaker global growth, while upside risks relate to  accommodative domestic policies maintained for too long. In 2011/12, growth is expected to  
5  
revert to potential, estimated at about 8 percent. Mostly due to base effects, headline inflation  (WPI) is projected to decline to 6½ percent (March 2011) compared to the RBI's projection  of 5.5 percent; higher food and commodity prices are the key risks. Surging capital inflows  could also complicate macroeconomic management.  
Authorities’ Views  
5. While the authorities forecast slightly lower growth for 2010/11, they expect  growth to return to 9 percent quickly. They project this year’s growth at 8.5 percent, but  anticipate a return to potential growth from 2011/12, which they estimate at about 9 percent  given the high investment ratio and the current levels of efficiency in capital use.  
6. The authorities share the view that the main risks stem from global  developments, with a special emphasis on commodity prices. Lower world growth could  dampen the takeoff of corporate investment outside of infrastructure, as a significant portion  of the manufacturing industry is now directly or indirectly linked to global markets. Rising  commodity prices could compound this effect, as well as weigh on the current account  deficit. 
II. Policy Discussions  
A. Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability  
Is inflation a concern?  
7. Despite some moderation, inflation is high and has become generalized. From a  trough of -0.7 percent y/y in June 2009, WPIinflation surged to double digits in early 2010,  declining to 8.6 percent y/y in October. Core inflation (WPI excluding food and energy) is at  7<U+2153> percent y/y, well above the RBI’s medium-term objective. CPI inflation (industrial  workers, IW), which has a higher weight on food, is at 9.8 percent y/y. In sequential terms,  both WPI and CPI inflation have picked up again. Inflation expectations are above historical  averages. Given the economy’s momentum and structural pressures on food prices, there are  risks that inflation will exceed staff’s projections and move to a higher plateau.  
8. Staff analysis suggests significant inflation inertia and rapid transmission of  supply shocks to core inflation. India’s inflation is persistent, suggesting that inflation  expectations are backward-looking (Annex 1). As in other developing countries, energy and  food price shocks feed into core inflation, particularly when there is little slack in the  economy.  
9. The RBI has rightly tightened monetary policy, but monetary conditions remain  accommodative. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) has been raised by 100 basis points (bp) and  the repo rate by 150 bp to 6.25 percent since December 2009 (Figure 3). There are several  measures of real interest rates, but short-term real rates using market forecasts remain 
6  
negative or barely positive and some 75-100bp below the level implied by Taylor rule  calculations (Annex 2). Financing conditions have hardened only marginally as the rupee has  appreciated modestly, capital market issuance has been strong, and lending rates have risen  less than policy rates though the transmission is still in train.  
10. Policy rates need to rise to bring the real repo rate clearly into positive territory  and in line with historical norms. Capacity utilization varies across sectors, but staff  estimate that the output gap has closed, providing little restraint on pricing power, while  fiscal stimulus is only being withdrawn slowly. Services prices and anecdotal evidence  suggest that wages are increasing rapidly. Further, growing rural incomes and an inelastic  food supply indicate that food prices could soon resume their ascent. Boosting agricultural  productivity and reducing policy distortions will also be vital to improve the supply response  of food commodities over the medium term.  
11. The RBI has significantly enhanced its communications. It has increased the  frequency of its policy reviews and in its latest review has provided forward guidance on its  future actions. These welcome developments help manage expectations. To further anchor  expectations, the RBI could publish its one-year ahead inflation forecasts on a rolling basis.  
12. Over time, the RBI could consider giving more weight to the CPI in the conduct  of monetary policy. The WPI is the focus of policymaking, but since 2008 the CPI has at  times diverged considerably from the WPI. As food is a major component of households’  consumption and food inflation affects core inflation, assigning greater weight to the CPI in  policy formulation could increase the impact of monetary policy on inflation expectations.  Also, monetary transmission could be strengthened by reducing the width of the policy rate  corridor and linking administered savings rates to market rates: these issues are being studied  by the RBI.  
Authorities’ Views  
13. Inflation remains above the RBI’s comfort level, and recent increases in food  prices may be structural. Consistent with their lower growth projections, the authorities  expect WPI inflation to fall to 5.5 percent by March 2011, but they are concerned about the  rise in inflation expectations. Food inflation is now concentrated in high-protein items that  account for a growing share of the consumption basket due to rising incomes, suggesting that  it is being driven by structural supply-demand mismatches. Higher commodity prices,  quantitative easing in developed economies, and structural food inflation domestically and  world-wide indicate that the risks to inflation are largely on the upside.  
14. Measures introduced since October 2009 are expected to lower inflation. The  transmission of monetary policy has intensified since mid-2010, when liquidity tightened,  pushing the call rate to the upper end of the policy corridor. This, combined with the base  rate reform, has led to higher lending rates, which should increase further as banks’ funding  
costs have risen. In addition, some reforms to monetary operations may be implemented after 
7  
receiving the recommendations of the committee tasked with assessing India’s monetary  policy framework. Hence, the authorities expect inflation to converge to historical averages  of about 5 percent going forward.  
15. The RBI has signaled that the likelihood of further rate actions in the immediate  future is low, but this does not rule out further tightening. Successive rate hikes and the  move of the call rate from the bottom to the top of the policy corridor have brought short term market rates close to a level the RBI considers to be right under current circumstances.  Also, falling inflation should bring real interest rates into positive territory by March 2011.  With measures already taken yet to have their full effect on financing conditions, particularly  at longer maturities, and with technical factors expected to lower inflation in coming months,  the RBI is taking stock of the monetary policy transmission that is underway, without  prejudging policy actions at the January Review.  
16. The RBI deems that new WPI index remains the most appropriate inflation  measure for policy purposes. While in the long run it may be desirable to express inflation  objectives in terms of consumer prices, for the time being the new WPI, with a wider  coverage and updated weights, remains the most representative measure of inflation nation wide. Nevertheless, the RBI will continue to evaluate an array of measures of inflation,  including asset prices and surveys of expectations, in pursuit of its inflation-related  objectives.  
Is fiscal consolidation sufficient?  
17. After two years of large deficits, the  
5 
consolidation targeted for 2010/11 is likely to be met

18. A commendable first step in fuel price liberalization has been taken and  promising tax reforms are in the works. The government has liberalized gasoline prices  and promised eventually to follow suit with diesel prices. The new Direct Tax Code (DTC)  retains some of the current incentives while phasing out the major profit-linked business  exemptions and rationalizes deduction on savings to broaden the tax base. Agreement on the  Goods and Services Tax (GST) has yet to be reached, further delaying the implementation of  a structurally sound and modern indirect tax.  
19. To help reduce overheating and reconstitute fiscal space, overperformance in  receipts should be saved. As the recent global crisis has shown, public finances need to  overperform in good times to reconstitute fiscal space for countercyclical policy. With  several spending measures expiring this year (e.g. 6th Pay Commission arrears), 2010/11  presents an opportunity for greater consolidation, which would facilitate reaching the  2011/12 target. Furthermore, given high government debt and large capital inflows, fiscal  consolidation would be the preferred macroeconomic tool to cool the economy.  
20. The government has reiterated its commitment to fiscal consolidation, but  achieving future deficit targets will be challenging. The 13th Finance Commission (FC)  called for general government deficits to contract by 4 percentage points of GDP between  2009/10 and 2014/15 and public debt to fall from 79 to 68 percent of GDP— the first time  debt is targeted, and a welcome development (Figure 4). At the same time, the FC called for  an increase in capital spending of 2½ percentage points of GDP, and for bringing all subsidy  outlays above the line. The government’s commitment to abide by the FC’s deficit targets  and to reduce debt to 65 percent of GDP is significant, and the envisaged revenue buoyancy  plausible. But the savings assumed in the new Government Debt Report (GDR) on pensions,  wages, subsidies, and interest payments could be difficult to achieve as these areas totaled  only 8 percent of GDP in 2009/10. On the other hand, states are expected to meet the FC's  targets.  
21. Substantial adjustment in current spending will be required to achieve the  proposed medium-term consolidation. International experience suggests that expenditure based adjustments tend to be more durable, and in India there is significant scope for  rationalization. Much will depend on cutting subsidies, both for fuel and fertilizers, and  better targeting of spending—the latter could be helped considerably by effective use of the  Unique Identification number (UID), which should be exploited as soon as technically  feasible. Over the longer term, greater use of performance-based incentives could improve  social outcomes. The Finance Minister's call for the Comptroller and Auditor General to  report on the quality of expenditure and whether it is achieving its desired objectives is a  welcome development.  
22. Building on recent budget reforms could facilitate consolidation. The GDR  strengthens transparency and India's medium-term budget framework. The authorities could  also detail their plan quantifying how to fit rising capital and social spending into a budget 
9  
envelope that declines as a share of GDP. To minimize the risk of reversals in consolidation,  amending the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act as the FC recommended,  including to tighten escape clauses and introduce a fiscal oversight committee, will be key.  
Authorities’ Views  
23. The authorities are confident of achieving this year’s consolidation target of  5.5 percent of GDP for the central government deficit. They emphasize that the size of the  supplementary demands for grants is an outcome of the larger-than-expected receipts. They  note that without higher revenue receipts, expenditure would have been kept to budgeted  levels, thereby ensuring that the deficit target would still have been met. Noting that much  additional spending has gone into priority areas such as rural infrastructure, the authorities  emphasize that future spending will remain commensurate with resources. The consolidated  general government deficit (authorities’ definition) is estimated at 9.7 percent of GDP in  2009/10. Gradually declining levels of debt over the medium term ensure sustainability.  Certain characteristics of the existing debt stock, e.g. longer maturity profile, fixed rates, and  the lower share of external debt, coupled with economic factors such as high domestic  savings rate, put India in a distinct category when compared to developed as well as other  EM economies.  
24. The government is committed to the consolidation plan envisaged in the GDR.  The GDR lowers the medium-term debt target to 65 percent of GDP from the 68 percent  recommended by the FC. Further, fiscal consolidation should be seen in the context of  India’s rapid growth. Strong growth will boost revenue, which the authorities expect to  contribute to the envisaged consolidation, along with the expenditure items specified in the  GDR (wages, pensions, interest, and subsidies), which will continue to decline as a share of  GDP.  
25. Streamlining expenditures will be an important contributor to this  consolidation. The authorities expect to continue to reduce subsidies as a percentage of  GDP. Further, growth in social sector programs will be taken up without affecting the fiscal  consolidation process. Finally, the introduction of UID is expected to provide a major boost  to targeting of social programs, both for those currently underway as well as any expansion  of food programs.  
Other systemic issues  
26. The current account deficit warrants monitoring. It is projected to reach  3.3 percent of GDP in 2010/11 and 3.5 percent next year (Annex 4). As the deficit rises, so  does the potential impact of a sudden stop or reversal of capital flows, requiring vigilance.  However, investment is the main driver, and the deficit has so far been financed mainly by  FDI and equity inflows. A further rise in the current account deficit can be avoided over the  medium term if India’s exports continue to gain market share and investment leads to higher 
10  
productivity. Finally, India’s external vulnerability indicators continue to compare well to  other EMs, with external debt at only 20 percent of GDP.  
27. A key risk stems from capital inflows exceeding the country’s absorptive  capacity by a large margin. At 4 percent of GDP during the past year, current inflows do  not appear to pose problems. But with low yields in advanced economies and favorable  growth differentials, capital inflows could become significantly larger. Absorptive capacity is  difficult to pinpoint, but inflows could be deemed to exceed it if they surpass the current  account deficit norm, or put significant pressure on the exchange rate, asset prices, and  monetary and credit aggregates.1  
28. Exchange rate flexibility should continue to be the first line of defense, while  reserve accumulation and selective administrative measures might become appropriate  if inflows surge. According to the IMF’s CGER, the rupee is valued broadly in line with  fundamentals. This is also consistent with  
the fact that the real effective exchange  120 
rate has appreciated modestly over the  110 
last five years and is only 6 percent  above its 10-year average, despite India’s  
100 
strong growth during the same period.  90 
Hence, some appreciation would not be  disruptive for the economy, and would  
80 
reduce incentives for additional inflows.  70

domestic financial markets, such as by continuing to increase share supply (for example by  increasing the minimum float requirement for state enterprises) and further developing the  corporate bond market. Liberalizing FDI would have similar effects. These measures would  dampen the impact of inflows on asset markets, direct those inflows to productive uses, and  encourage longer-term and less volatile flows. But if the appreciation is persistent and  excessive, and capital inflows too large and volatile, other options can include sterilized  intervention, raising the CRR, and macroprudential measures. India already has a framework  of capital controls, especially on debt, so introducing new controls should be a last resort: if  necessary, existing external commercial borrowing (ECB) regulations could be tightened, as  the authorities have done in the past.

foreign inflows, has recovered smartly, while the commercial and retail segments remain  soft. The RBI has remained vigilant and recently tightened prudential norms on residential  mortgages. More action could be warranted if asset markets were to become exuberant.  
30. The banking system has been resilient, and vigilance on asset quality and  liquidity risk is being exercised. The recovery has improved the credit profile of  restructured assets, banks have significantly reduced their exposure to unsecured retail  lending, and stress tests indicate that doubling of non-performing loans (NPLs) would leave  banks above the regulatory minimum capital requirement (Annex 5). Market indicators have  improved. Nevertheless, NPLs have inched up and asset/liability mismatches have increased  as deposit growth has lagged credit growth and infrastructure loans and residential mortgages  have expanded the fastest. Monitoring asset quality and raising provisioning coverage remain  priorities, as well as strengthening risk management and credit assessment capabilities,  especially as prudential norms for infrastructure are being eased to promote much-needed  investment in this area.  
31. With the increasing sophistication of the Indian financial system, monitoring  risks in an integrated fashion and ensuring a regulatory level playing field pose  challenges for regulators. Non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) are expanding more  rapidly than banks, infrastructure NBFCs have been introduced, and both interconnectedness  and product competition across institutions are intensifying. The authorities have taken  welcome steps, such as efforts to prevent regulatory arbitrage, the new supervision  framework for financial conglomerates, the introduction of the RBI’s Financial Stability  Report, and the announced review of financial laws and the Financial Stability and  Development Council (FSDC). The FSDC will have to balance the independence of  regulators with the need to resolve regulatory disputes and differences of views on financial  reforms. The forthcoming FSAP could also contribute with a comprehensive assessment of  financial stability and development priorities. The authorities are also encouraged to continue  their efforts toward anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism  (AML/CFT), including by implementing the recommendations of Financial Action Task  Force’s AML/CFT Mutual Evaluation Report.  
12  
Authorities’ Views  
32. The authorities believe the widening of the current account deficit is transitory.  They agree that if current growth differentials between India and advanced economies  persist, the deficit could be somewhat higher this year and next than in 2009/10. The RBI  deems a deficit above 3 percent of GDP is difficult to sustain over the medium term, and will  focus policies on reducing the medium-term deficit to this level, while ensuring financing for  a larger short-term deficit relies mainly on long-term and stable capital inflows.  
33. Policymakers draw a distinction between the positive role that capital inflows  can play in powering growth, and short-term risks that large and volatile capital  inflows can entail. Current inflows are within the country’s absorptive capacity and some  further increase can be managed with conventional policy responses. At the same time, the  expectation of further quantitative easing in advanced economies could result in large capital  inflows, exchange rate appreciation, and rising asset prices in India as in other EMs. The RBI  will also continue to use macroprudential tools to modulate asset prices. Unlike many other  countries, India has liberalized capital inflows since the crisis in line with the need to finance  investments and its long-term policy objectives, and does not plan to reverse course unless  capital flows exceed current levels by a large margin.  
34. The financial system at the current juncture is largely stable. Concerns about  asset quality are mitigated by high capital adequacy, which exceeds 14 percent with tier one  at 10 percent, and increased provisioning cover. The RBI does not see systemic risks  emanating from a possible increase in NPLs of microfinance institutions. Liquidity risk is  manageable given the statutory liquidity requirement, the CRR, and the fact that the business  model of Indian banks remains centered on retail deposits. The RBI has issued new  guidelines on asset liability management, including management of interest rate risk. Steps  are being taken to strengthen macro-prudential surveillance, minimize regulatory arbitrage  across types of institutions, improve information systems to monitor interconnectedness, and  strengthen supervision of non bank institutions. The FSDC is expected to make an important  contribution in this area.  
B. Structural Change and Reform: the Infrastructure Challenge  
35. The Indian authorities have emphasized infrastructure and human capital  investment to reach their goal of 9-10 percent GDP growth over the medium term, and  reiterated this to the G-20. These investments would alleviate supply constraints, as well as  support private demand and contribute to strong, sustainable, and balanced global growth.  Based on a variety of methods, staff currently estimates India’s potential growth rate at  7½-8½ percent. Infrastructure and human capital investment could help raise this. 
36. The shift toward  
infrastructure that began in 2007  will have to continue to attain the

infrastructure investment by 2011/12 to attain the five-year target of around US$500 billion.  The 12th Plan (2012/13-2016/17) has not yet been formulated, but a mooted figure of US$1  trillion would boost infrastructure investment to 9 percent of GDP, while private  participation would be targeted to rise to half the total.  
37. There are several roadblocks to achieving the infrastructure targets and higher  growth. These include availability of finance or financing instruments, for which several  measures have been taken (see below), as well as land acquisition, multiple clearances,  capacity constraints, governance issues, along with various sector-specific concerns.  Structural reforms in these areas would lower the cost of infrastructure, encourage private  investment, and allow more efficient use of public resources.  
38. A staff study shows that in most EMs infrastructure booms are financed  publicly, but private sector participation has risen with increased financial  sophistication (Annex 6). Looking specifically at four major EMs (China, Brazil, Chile, and  Korea) provides some lessons for India. Fiscal consolidation will be important to free public  resources for investment in areas where private participation will not be forthcoming, such as  urban infrastructure and power distribution: Korea and Brazil, especially, have relied on  budgetary resources and public development banks. In China, local governments have played  a key role, including by using proceeds from land premia to defray some costs. Mobilizing  private sector funds in Chile, China, and Korea required a cultivation of institutional  investors, credit enhancements, and reducing regulatory risk, while Chile’s success in  intermediating foreign savings depended on its open business environment and well developed financial markets.  
39. India’s favorable demographics should ensure sufficient domestic savings for  infrastructure investment over the medium term, but foreign savings also need to rise  in the near term. Private savings are likely to continue rising gradually (Annex 7). Public  savings are also expected to rise, but reaching the public sector infrastructure goals while  meeting the fiscal consolidation roadmap will require strict containment of unproductive  
14  
spending. In the near term, overall domestic savings may be insufficient to meet the  investment increase, necessitating a transitory widening of the current account deficit. To  ensure that foreign capital flows to infrastructure projects, the recent increase in foreign  institutional investors (FII) debt limits is welcome,2 and could be further extended as the  limits approach their full utilization.  
40. Ensuring more efficient intermediation of domestic savings will require  sustained efforts toward financial reforms. Significant progress has been made in  developing the corporate bond market, which has seen increased issuance and turnover. Also,  some takeout finance transactions have taken place and foreign investors have been allowed  to provide credit enhancements. But much greater participation by domestic institutional  investors in the bond market and infrastructure funding is still needed, which depends on  changing investment allocations and reducing the public sector borrowing requirement. At  the same time, credit enhancements will be important to maintain investor protection.  Continuing to boost bond market liquidity and develop securitization and hedging  instruments both remain important to ensure sufficient long-term rupee debt resources are  available to finance India’s investment needs, while helping banks manage their liquidity and  concentration risks. Financial inclusion will allow more savings to be intermediated through  the financial system. The New Pension System will raise contractual savings, but this will  take time.  
41. Large infrastructure projects also raise opportunities for large rents to be  sought by all players, which can be mitigated by robust frameworks and transparency.  Other countries’ experience suggests that large investment drives can be accompanied by  weakening governance standards and incentives can be distorted so that risks are  predominantly borne by the public sector. Strengthening accountability systems, bolstering  transparency, and increasing competition could help mitigate these risks.  
Authorities’ Views  
42. The authorities broadly agree with staff’s assessment of India’s progress on  infrastructure. Under the 11th Plan the private sector has contributed about 30 percent of  financing so far, and it is expected that under the 12th Plan private participation will have to  rise to half, making India’s Public-Private Partnership program one of the most ambitious in  the world. The authorities expect a financing shortfall in the coming years unless more long term debt sources can be mobilized.  
43. Recognizing this, the authorities are engaged in a focused effort to remove the  remaining bottlenecks to the development of the corporate debt market. The authorities  
2 In September 2010, FII debt limits were raised by $10 billion in bonds with a residual maturity greater than  5 years. 
15  
are also working on expanding the domestic investor base, trying to tap retail investors and  increasing bank participation, as well as creating a robust system of market makers.  
44. The authorities’ infrastructure agenda has moved forward in other areas as  well. Land acquisition, particularly in culturally or environmentally sensitive areas, is a  challenge, but the government is considering ways to expedite implementation of  infrastructure projects, while minimizing displacements and improving compensation  assessments. Speeding up approval processes is complicated, but the introduction of  standardized PPP contracts for roads and ports, as well as a national program for capacity  building in PPP formulation at the state level, should begin to ease these bottlenecks.  
III. Staff Appraisal  
45. India’s growth remains among the strongest in the world and its medium-term  prospects are favorable. The economy is expected to grow above trend this year and to  continue to expand rapidly over the medium term, supported by high investment and  productivity gains. Social indicators are improving, consistent with the authorities’ goal of  inclusive growth. Risks to growth are broadly balanced.  
46. Robust growth and elevated inflation warrant prompt action in completing the  normalization of the monetary and fiscal stance. The authorities have started a calibrated  exit from expansionary policies implemented during the global crisis. The overperformance  in this year's central government budget presents an opportunity to reconstitute fiscal space  
faster and reduce the risk of overheating, particularly as fiscal policy is the preferred focus  for policy tightening given the high level of government debt and large capital inflows.  
47. Lowering inflation to meet the RBI’s objective requires further monetary  tightening. Over the last year, the RBI has raised policy rates and the CRR, and the  transmission to long-term rates is still taking place. But further increases in policy rates are  needed to bring real short-term interest rates in line with historical norms. India’s controls on  debt flows are expected to dampen the effect of wider interest rate differentials on capital  inflows. More rapid withdrawal of fiscal stimulus would have helped contain demand  pressures, but in its absence, a greater burden falls on monetary policy to cool the economy  and counter prevailing perceptions that inflation has shifted to a higher level.  
48. The government’s renewed commitment to fiscal consolidation is welcome, but  spending reforms will be needed. The government has laid out an ambitious roadmap to  reduce public debt and deficits. High growth is expected to contribute toward this goal, but  the need to raise public investment, especially in infrastructure, and expand social programs  will make this challenging. With the tax reforms designed to be revenue neutral, subsidy  reform will have to continue, especially by liberalizing diesel and fertilizer prices, and  spending efficiency will have to improve. Strengthening budget frameworks along the FC's  recommendations will be important to minimize the risk of reversals in fiscal consolidation. 
16  
49. The authorities are rightly monitoring the current account deficit. The current  account deficit has been financed mainly by FDI and equity flows and is expected to narrow  over the medium term as exports expand on the back of productivity gains. However, the  potential impact of a reversal in capital inflows has risen, requiring vigilance.  
50. India's flexible exchange rate serves the country well in managing capital  inflows. So far, the rupee has appreciated only modestly and is deemed to be broadly in line  with fundamentals. Nevertheless, given yield and growth differentials, capital inflows could  exceed India’s absorptive capacity by a large margin. If so, exchange rate appreciation  should remain the first line of defense. Were appreciation to become too large, sterilized  intervention or macroprudential measures could also be taken. Over time, deepening the  corporate bond market, increasing the supply of shares, and further liberalizing FDI would  increase absorptive capacity and the share of relatively stable capital inflows.  
51. Financial policies and reforms are balancing financial stability considerations  with the need to finance investment and growth. Although the financial sector has been  resilient and is benefiting from robust growth, the authorities' vigilance on asset quality and  liquidity risk is appropriate. Deeper interconnectedness, increasing sophistication of the  Indian financial system, as well as the measures taken to promote infrastructure financing,  will continue to put a premium on integrated supervision.  
52. Efforts to facilitate infrastructure investment are bearing fruit and will need to  be sustained to meet the authorities' ambitious goals. While domestic savings are  expected to rise due to India’s favorable demographics and rapid growth, greater recourse to  foreign savings is also likely needed in the near term. More efficient intermediation of  domestic savings will require continued financial reforms, chief among these a vibrant  corporate bond market, which has shown considerable development. Lowering the costs of  doing business—especially by streamlining land acquisition, addressing governance issues,  and reducing red tape—is also critical to boost private sector participation in infrastructure.  
53. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the  standard 12-month cycle.

ANNEX 1. INFLATION DYNAMICS IN INDIA1 
Introduction  
1. Since 2007, India’s inflation has been  trending upwards. During 2000-09, India’s  25 
consumer price inflation (CPI industrial  workers, IW) averaged 5½ percent, but  
20 
9.5 percent in 2008-09. This compares with  
15 
2 percent in China, 7 percent in Brazil, and  10 
14 percent in Russia.

with the great moderation trends exhibited  elsewhere, inflation volatility was relatively  stable in the first half of the 2000s and even  declined after 2005. But with the increase in

international commodity prices and domestic food prices and their respective volatilities, the  variability of inflation (measured by the 12-month rolling standard deviation) increased  twofold, from 2 percent before 2005 to an average of 4 percent in 2008-09.  
3. Despite the existence of administered prices in key components of the WPI and  CPI baskets as well as other distortions, headline inflation is significantly correlated  with international commodity prices. First, the energy (fuel) component of the WPI  comoves strongly with international oil prices.  3084881755141
The comovement is stronger when international  
oil prices are lagged by three months. Second,  
the domestic energy component of the WPI is  
also significantly correlated with domestic core  
inflation, suggesting that movements in  
domestic underlying inflation have occurred in  
tandem with shocks to international oil prices.  
In the case of food, the correlation between  
international food prices and domestic prices is  
much smaller and is more volatile. The lack of  
comovement between international and domestic food prices stems primarily from barriers to  trade, price controls, and other public policies.

New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) Estimates for India  
4. To shed light on inflation dynamics, this annex estimates a NKPC for India. The  NKPC framework is useful to assess quantitatively the role of inertia, demand and supply  factors in the inflation process. According to the NKPC, inflation is given by  
<U+03A0>t = <U+03BB>mct + ßEt<U+03A0>t+1 
where <U+03A0>t = pt – pt-1 , <U+03BB> = (1 – <U+03B8>)(1 – ß<U+03B8>)/<U+03B8>, with theta being the probability that prices remain  unchanged in a given period and beta being the discount factor. In the case of the augmented  NKPC, a lagged inflation term is added,  
<U+03A0>t = <U+03BB>mct + <U+03B3>fEt<U+03A0>t+1 + <U+03B3>b<U+03A0>t-1 
5. Empirically, the model requires a proxy for the marginal cost term and proper  treatment of inflation expectations. Gali and Gertler (1999) use the labor share of income  as a proxy for marginal costs, but here the output gap is used in the estimations because of  data availability. In the case of expected inflation, survey based data could be used or the  equation can be estimated by Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) techniques, which  instruments expected inflation with past inflation and other exogenous variables (generally  lagged regressors). In the case of India, a continuous and reasonably long sample of expected  inflation is not available and the NKPC is estimated by GMM. To account for the openness  of the economy to international trade, further modifications are made. In an open economy,  marginal costs faced by firms are directly affected by imported inputs, and the NKPC is  augmented with a measure of import prices or international commodity prices. Three  measures are considered, but the estimated coefficients are robust to the measures used in the  estimations: (1) an index of oil prices in domestic currency; (2) the index of fuel and non-fuel  commodity prices in domestic currency; and (3) the same index as in (2) relative to domestic  CPI for industrial workers (IW), which proxies wage costs.  
6. The NKPC is fitted to headline (WPI) inflation and to core (WPI excluding food  and energy) inflation. The inflation measure used is the quarter-on-quarter annualized  change of the price index. The data are seasonally adjusted prior to estimations and span  1996-Q2 to 2010-Q1. Alternative measures of the output gap are used in the estimations  (factor costs GDP, factor costs GDP excluding agriculture, and market price GDP). The  baseline estimates presented below are for core inflation and the output gap is calculated  from non-agriculture GDP at factor costs.  
7. The analysis of inflation dynamics using the NKPC suggests that in the case of  India both forward-looking and backward-looking inflation are important  determinants of inflation (Table 1): 
32  
· Inflation inertia is significant, as the coefficient of lagged inflation is generally large  (positive) and statistically significant. The estimated effect of lagged inflation on  current inflation typically exceeds 0.70 and is about two to three times as large as that  of expected inflation.  
· Expected inflation also has an effect on current inflation, but it is smaller than past  inflation: a one percentage point increase in expected inflation leads to 0.2 to 0.4  percentage point increase in inflation depending on the specification.  
· The effect of the output gap on inflation is generally economically significant and  ranges between 0.4-0.8 across specifications. Its statistical significance, however,  depends on the measure of inflation used and to a smaller extent, also on the output  gap measure used.  
· International commodity prices are an important cost push factor and exert an effect  on inflation beyond that incorporated in expectations or past inflation.  
· Domestic food prices also act as a cost push factor, with a one percentage point  increase in food inflation translating into 0.15 percentage point increase in core  inflation. Although not statistically significant in all specifications, the inclusion of  domestic food prices improves the fit of the model. The coefficient on food inflation  remains broadly unchanged when a backward-looking version of the PC is estimated.  In addition, the long term response of core inflation to a one percentage point  increase in food inflation is in the order of 0.4 percentage points. This is consistent  with the view outlined in Gokarn (2010) that food prices “have been a major driver of  domestic inflation over the past few years”.

8. The in-sample fit of the open economy NKPC is good. The empirical  model captures the turning points in core  inflation reasonably well. Yet, the model  under-predicts inflation in the last quarter of  2009 and first quarter of 2010. The fit is  also marginally worse when the commodity  price measure is not included.  
9. The important role of food prices  in driving inflation in India becomes  clearer once inflation is disaggregated  into its food and nonfood components.  The volatility of food price shocks is higher  and large upward shocks are more common  and persistent. In addition, the transmission  mechanism between food and nonfood  prices is stronger than in rich countries  (APD REO, Fall 2010, Box 2.1). The large  food price shocks observed in recent years  in India could thus be expected to have a

substantial effect on headline inflation. For  example, between September 2008 and July  2010, food prices rose rapidly due to a poor

monsoon and rising rural incomes. If these price shocks had been transmitted to nonfood  prices in the way food price shocks are transmitted in the United States, overall inflation  would have been only 3 percent during this period.  
10. The importance of food prices for the determination of inflation also has  normative implications. This is challenging for inflation modelers since, as shown by  Gokarn (2010), the interplay between the dynamics of different types of food items and  overall food inflation also reflects rapidly changing spending patterns on food. Nonetheless,  Prasad and Anand (2010) show that when food is a major part of the consumption basket and  in the presence of financial frictions , such as when a large share of households are credit  constrained, a welfare-maximizing central bank should target headline CPI inflation, while  assigning some weight to the output gap. This is relevant in India because the share of food  expenditure in total spending is high and the ability to smooth consumption may be limited.  
34  
Conclusions  
11. The main findings can be summarized as follows:  
· India’s inflation has increased recently, with both demand and supply factors playing  important roles.  
· Unlike food prices, which are driven by domestic factors, the comovement between  the energy component of headline inflation and lagged international prices is strong.  Also, domestic energy inflation is highly correlated with headline inflation.  
· Phillips curve estimates suggest that the backward-looking component of inflation  expectations is large, but that the output gap and (forward looking) expected inflation  are also important to understanding inflation dynamics.  
· International commodity prices help deliver a good fit, but their effect on core and  headline inflation operates with long lags.  
· The inclusion of domestic food prices as a second cost-push factor improves the in sample fit of the model.  
· In poorer countries, food prices are found to be more volatile and to spillover onto  nonfood prices more than in richer countries.

ANNEX 2. ASSESSING THE RBI’S MONETARY POLICY STANCE1 
1. The RBI has been withdrawing monetary accommodation since late 2009.  Initially, the RBI raised the Statutory Liquidity Requirement to its pre-crisis level  (25 percent) and eliminated or reduced special liquidity facilities introduced during the crisis.  Since the beginning of 2010, the RBI has raised its repo (reverse repo) policy rate by 150  (200) basis points and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 100 basis points. The RBI has  communicated to markets that the normalization of monetary conditions is needed given that  the recovery is consolidating and inflation pressures have become more broad-based. The  RBI has recently provided forward guidance on its future actions, including by signaling a  pausing of interest rate hikes in the immediate future.  
2. Short-term money market rates have increased by more than the policy rates. In  addition to the changes in the policy rates, the call money rate (which until April was  hovering near the bottom of the policy corridor) also rose to the top of corridor as interbank  liquidity became scarcer.2 The RBI has also taken measures to alleviate the liquidity  shortage, including by allowing banks to use up to 2 percent of their portfolio of government  securities to borrow from special liquidity adjustment facility windows (effectively lowering  the SLR by 2 percentage points).  
3. Despite the interest rate hikes, several indicators suggest that monetary  conditions remain accommodative.  
· Short-term interest rates remain low by historical standards. The RBI has only  partially reversed the interest cuts it put in place during the crisis (it had cut the  reverse repo rate by 275 basis points (bps) and the repo rate by 425 bps), despite a  return to close to pre-crisis growth and the rapid rise in inflation.3 
· Short-term rates remain negative in real terms. With the latest headline inflation at  8.6 percent y/y, the real call money rate is still at -2.3 percent, between 350-500 basis  
1 Prepared by Roberto Guimarães.  
2 Some of the variation in liquidity was widely anticipated and resulted from the payment of 3G license and  broadband wireless spectrum auctions as well as tax payments. However, tight liquidity has persisted.  
3 Short-term interest rates have been generally higher (at 8-9 percent) when the economy is in a cyclically strong  position (e.g., when output gap is estimated to be closed or positive). For instance, in June 2008, the call money  rate was around 8.5 percent while growth was slightly below the current pace (7.8 percent in 2008Q2 versus  8.8 percent in 2010Q2) and CPI inflation was near 8 percent y/y. The analysis in Box III.2 in RBI (2010)  suggests that “a neutral rate approximated in terms of the call rate over a medium term horizon provides a broad  reference point for assessing the stance of monetary policy.”

points below its historical average (about 1½ percent). Bank deposit rates are also  well into negative territory. At their current levels short-term rates would remain  negative for the rest of the fiscal year, as inflation is only projected to decline  gradually to around 6.5 percent y/y by March 2011 and 6 percent (average) in  2011/12. Even using the RBI’s inflation projection of 5.5 percent for March 2011  would still leave the real repo rate at 0.75 percent, whereas measures of the natural  real rate are generally above that level (especially for a rapidly growing economy).  
· Interest rates are also low according to standard Taylor-rule benchmarks. Taylor  rule calculations suggest that the short-term interest rate is below its neutral levels or  historical benchmarks accounting for the output gap and inflation. Taylor rules are  estimated with data covering 1996-2010. Two Taylor rules are used:4 (i) a benchmark  
“calibrated” Taylor rule in which the  responses to the output gap and  
inflation gap (deviation of inflation

4. Despite some moderation in inflation in recent months, inflation expectations  have drifted upwards. 
4 The 3-month T-bill rate is used in the estimation because it is empirically indistinguishable from the call  money rate, but does not have the spikes and higher volatility of the latter. Using the call money rate in the  estimations yields the same coefficients of the Taylor rule, but reduces the fit of the equation and increases the  standard error of the coefficients.  
5 The calibrated rule has the following responses to the inflation gap and output gap: 1.5 and 0.5. In the  estimated rule, the responses are 0.7 and 1.6. The inertial component of the estimated rule is also higher  compared to the calibrated one: 0.9 versus 0.75. The optimal rule in Anand et al. (2010) also displays a high  degree of inertia, but it also includes the exchange rate. Some of the rules estimated by Patra and Kanpur (2010)  show a stronger response to inflation over longer horizons.

· One-year ahead expected inflation from professional forecasters have increased by a  full percentage point between March 2009 and March 2010. Moreover, since early  2010, the distribution of expected inflation from Consensus Forecasts has shifted to  the right and became more fat-tailed,

5. There is little slack in the economy and the output gap is significantly correlated  with inflation, suggesting a return of pricing power. 
· The measures of the output gap show that the rapid rebound from crisis has virtually  eliminated the gap between actual and potential GDP. While in 2007-08 GDP was  advancing faster than its potential growth rate, in early 2009 there was substantial  slack in the economy. With the swift rebound in growth, the output gap is estimated  to have closed. More importantly, while it is difficult to measure the size of the  output gap with precision, all measures point in the same direction. This is also  consistent with a measure of the output gap that excludes agriculture. 
· India’s inflation is correlated with the output gap. The correlations range from  0.15 percent in the case of WPI inflation to

ANNEX 3. INDIA: FISCAL DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS FOR CONSOLIDATION1 Background  
1. After two years of very high deficits, the 2010/11 budget was intended to begin the  process of fiscal consolidation. General government deficits in 2008/09 and 2009/10  exceeded ten percent of GDP, while central government deficits exceeded 6¾ percent of  GDP. The 2010/11 budget of the Center began the process of consolidation recommended by  the 13th Finance Commission (FC) and reiterated by the November 2010 Government Debt  Report. State government budgets were also expected to improve as the recovery came  underway.  
2. Since then, revenues have rebounded strongly, but rising expenditures have  necessitated supplementary budgets . The August and November supplementary demands  for grants amounted to 1.3 percent of GDP2.  
· Revenue growth has been quite strong in the recovery from the crisis. Despite rate  reductions, personal income tax collections are on track to exceed their 2007/08 peak  as a share of GDP, and the revival of corporate profits and foreign trade has buoyed  corporate income taxes and customs revenue. A partial rollback of the excise tax cut  taken during the crisis has also supported indirect tax revenues.  
· Current expenditure. Non-interest current expenditure was slated to grow by 3.4 y/y  percent in 2010/11, but in the first half of the year rose by 14.7 percent.  · Subsidies, which reached 2.3 percent of GDP in 2008/09, were budgeted to fall to  1.6 percent in 2010/11, with only a nominal amount for fuel subsidies. This has not  yet materialized, however, and even with the hikes to market prices for fuels and  liberalization of gasoline prices undertaken in June 2010, subsidies in 2010/11 are  still expected to be around 2 percent of GDP.  
· Capital spending. Nonmilitary capital spending was budgeted to rise by 18 percent:  its growth so far exceeds this rate.  
· One-off proceeds from the government’s auctions of 3G and broadband licenses as  well as divestment have been positive. The 3G auction raised twice its expected target  of Rs 350 billion. The government budgeted proceeds from divestment of shares in  public enterprises of Rs 400 billion for 2010/11, and this target is likely to be easily  met3.  
1 Prepared by James P. Walsh  
2 It should be noted that of these supplemental requests, Rs 85 billion (0.1 percent of GDP) was earmarked for  India’s IMF quota increase.  
3 The Indian government classifies the proceeds of the wireless and broadband auction licenses, as well as  proceeds from share sales, as revenue while IMF guidelines call for its classification as financing. 
40  
· State budgets are expected to contribute to fiscal consolidation this year as receipts  revive and spending, which rose by less than central government spending during the  crisis, remains under control. The 2009/10 deficit estimated at 3.7 percent of GDP  should improve this year to around 3.3 percent of GDP. 
· Current IMF staff forecasts place the deficit above the budgeted target; however,  this is not the case under the authorities’ methodology, which includes the proceeds  of various asset sales as revenue. 
Tax Reforms  
3. The government hopes to introduce a nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in  April 2012. The tax, which will be implemented as a value-added tax, is intended to replace  India’s web of state- and national level excise, sales and value added taxes with a unified  consumption-tax framework, and to move from origin- to destination-based taxation. Some  important features of the tax as currently proposed are:  
· The central government will tax goods at 10 percent, services at 8 percent, and  essential items at 6 percent, with the recommendation that the states add identical  rates4.  
· Within three years these rates are expected to converge to 8 percent.  · The entire consumption base will be taxed by bringing imports into the base while  excluding exports. Businesses with annual sales below Rs 1 million will be exempt.  · While many indirect taxes levied by the states and the central government will be  subsumed into the GST, taxation of fuels and alcohol will remain outside the GST for  the time being.  
4. The reform is designed to be revenue neutral, but its simplification relative to the  current system should increase revenues in the long run. The current proposal is similar to  the “Model GST” proposed by the FC with a few exceptions, such as the lack of a uniform  rate (though this is temporary), and a slightly longer list of exemptions. Revenues will be  shared between the central government and the states, but the FC recommended that states  which collected more revenue under the current tax structure (both from state level excise  taxes and their share of revenues from the central government sales tax) be compensated for  losses until 2014/15. The replacement of India’s distortionary current system with the more  streamlined GST is expected to increase compliance, and could have a positive impact on  growth.  
5. Approval of the GST will be a prolonged process. Changing the allocation of  taxation responsibilities from the states to the central government requires a constitutional    
4 That is, the total rate on goods would be 20 percent. Rates would be fixed nationwide, with the revenue pool  for the states allocated according to Finance Commission Recommendations. 
41  
amendment. This would have to pass with a qualified supermajority in Parliament and then  be approved by a majority of the states. As the Parliamentary opposition and many state  legislatures have raised objections to various aspects of the legislation, the prospects for  passage are not clear. After approval of the amendment, a GST bill based on this proposal  would be tabled in Parliament and would require only a majority vote.  
6. Parliament is expected to pass a new Direct Tax Code (DTC) soon. The DTC is  intended to modernize the framework for income and corporate taxes in India, which was last  updated in 1961. By limiting deductions, the draft tax code aims at increasing the tax base,  allowing for a reduction in tax rates while collecting a similar level of revenues. It is  expected to come into effect on April 1, 2012. Some important components of the legislation  are:  
Corporate Income Tax  
· Despite initial proposals to reduce the rate to 25 percent, the corporate income tax  rate has been maintained at 30 percent. However, the elimination of various cesses  and surcharges will reduce the effective rate.  
· Residence of corporations will be determined by their place of “effective  management.”  
· Corporate book profits will be taxed, rather than corporate assets or realized profits,  as originally proposed.  
Personal Income Tax  
· Capital gains will now be taxed as income, and foreign investors without labor  income will be taxed at the equivalent marginal rate on earnings, though a deduction  from the base will apply on assets held for more than one year. Capital gains taxes  will not apply to equity shares held for more than one year.  
· Retirement and certain other long-term savings will be taxed neither when earned nor  when withdrawn; reinvested capital gains will also not be taxed.  
· The narrower tax brackets included in the 2010/11 budget have been slightly  modified, furthering lowering marginal tax rates on some income ranges.  
Inclusive Growth and Fiscal Costs  
7. Given its relatively low social indicators compared to other countries, the Indian  government supports a broad range of social programs. Compared to other major emerging  markets (EMs), as well as other countries in the region, and despite rapid growth in recent  years, India’s social indicators remain comparatively weak (Table 1). Hence, social spending  is an important priority. However, spending on subsidies, primarily on fuels and fertilizers,  but also on food, accounts for a share of general government spending comparable to that of  health and rural development combined.

8. The government has announced  numerous expansions to social programs. 
Figure 1. India: General Government Spending  (percent of GDP) 
In recent years, the government has sought  to broaden the reach of programs aimed at  improving rural livelihoods and the  education system, and is likely to expand  its subsidized food programs. Widening  scope of social safety nets is an important  step in improving human welfare. But

9. The flagship National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREG) is large, though  the cost at present is manageable. NREGA, passed in February 2006 and fully implemented  across rural India in 2008, provides 100 days of work to any rural household that requests it.  
In 2010/11, the program’s budget is Rs 401 billion (0.5 percent of GDP). Wages under  NREG are low, averaging around Rs 90 per day in 2009/10, but have risen over time,  including a recommendation earlier this year that wages be raised to Rs 100 a day or linked  to states’ minimum wages. The program is extensive – in 2009/10, 53 million households  requested employment under the scheme –and the government is increasing awareness of the  
43  
program. However, the government sees this as a safety net rather than a program that will  displace regular employment.  
10. The uneven implementation of NREG across India points to a large scope for its  expansion, which could be costly. In the five states in which NREG has enrolled the largest  percentage of poor households, the program has enrolled around 85 percent of working age  poor persons5. In the rest of the country, only 21 percent of the working age poor have been  enrolled. The cost of expanding NREGA in those states with relatively low penetration to the  same level the program has attained in the most implemented states would be around  0.8 percent of GDP. Implementation on this broader scale would thus more than double the  current cost of the program. Tying wage rates to minimum wages could also raise costs.  
11. The 2009 Right to Education Act (RTE) could prove another major fiscal  undertaking. The law sets a goal of ensuring universal high quality education for children up  to age 14. In early years much expenditure under the program is likely to come under the  auspices of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) program, which has similar but narrower goals.  Implementation will be shared between the central government and the states. There is  already a broad range of support for education. The five states with the highest 2007 literacy  rates, averaging 95 percent, budgeted Rs 6100 per child on education in 2009/10, while the  rest of the states (with a combined literacy rate of 68 percent) budgeted on average Rs 4200  per child6. Improving literacy, rather than equalizing state spending on education, is the goal  of RTE. But as a guideline, raising per child expenditures for the 23 states with the lowest  literacy rates to the same level as those with the highest literacy rates would entail additional  costs of 0.9 percent of GDP.  
12. Finally, the Food Security Act (FSA) is on the horizon. The FSA has no timetable  yet for approval and is only now being fleshed out. The main point of the program would be  to provide 35 kg of rice or wheat each month to eligible households at a subsidized cost of Rs  3 a kilo7. It is not clear how broad the expansion of current programs will be: a recent  increase in the poverty line raised the estimate of poor households from 64 to 85 million,  
5 Staff estimates for this and further calculations below based on data from NREGA, the Census of India, the  Planning Commission, and the Reserve Bank of India’s Report on State Finances 2010/11. Given their different  treatment under India’s anti-poverty programs, the Northeastern states were excluded from the NREGA  analysis; the five states with the highest level of participation are Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh,  Karnataka, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu.  
6 The states with the highest literacy rates are Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Mizoram and Tripura.  
7 Under current policies, households below the poverty line pay slightly higher prices (Rs 4.2 per kilo for wheat  and Rs 5.7 for rice) for the same quantities, though 25 million households pay even lower prices under a  program called Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and additional support programs exist for children, the elderly,  and the working rural poor. 
44  
while even broader criteria have also been discussed, including some that would make  subsidized food grains universally available in poorer parts of the country.  
13. Such a large expansion of the social safety net should be undertaken with a view  toward increased efficiency of implementation. Leakages from social programs are difficult  to quantify, but estimates of losses are often quite large. A 2008 report by the Comptroller  General on NREG noted many discrepancies and a lack of transparency about how the  program was implemented in many parts of the country8. A similar report in 2006 on the  national food distribution system, which under some proposals would become the  implementing mechanism for the Food Security Act, found that many persons eligible for the  program were denied ration cards, and that many who did were unable to use the service on a  regular basis9. Another study finds not only that two-thirds of publicly distributed wheat does  not reach eligible persons, but that this percentage varies dramatically by state, implying that  more efficient distribution can cut losses10. On the other hand, the National Population  Register and introduction of the Unique Identification number (UID) is expected to help  reduce leakages and increase social safety net efficiency.  
Outlook for Medium-Term Consolidation  
14. The report of the 13th Finance Commission focused on fiscal consolidation but laid  out other important fiscal reforms. FC reports are published every five years. This year’s  report contained a number of significant proposals to enhance long-term fiscal sustainability:  
· For the first time, a public sector debt target was established, at 68 percent of GDP  (45 percent for the central government, both slightly above what the IMF had  recommended), with a path of fiscal consolidation for the central and general  governments (Table 2).  
· The FC also recommended:  
o increasing central government borrowing and revenue sharing during  downturns rather than raising states’ borrowing limits;  
o establishing an independent review mechanism to evaluate fiscal reforms;  o the Medium Term Fiscal Plan required under the Fiscal Responsibility and  Budget Management Act (FRBMA) be “made a statement of a commitment  rather than a statement of intent”;  
o amending the FRBMA to spell out clearly under what circumstances its  targets could be relaxed;

15. The November 2010 Government Debt Report (GDR) goes beyond these  recommendations. Nominal GDP  
growth above original forecasts has  reduced India’s debt-to-GDP ratios  and brought the FC debt target  closer. Noting this, the GDR lays

out the authorities’ commitment to  continue to abide by the challenging  deficit path laid out by the FC,  which thanks to higher GDP would  bring India’s general government  debt down to 65 percent of GDP by  2014/15, below the FC target.

represents an important step forward for transparency. By enumerating specific areas for  savings and presenting a five-year path for spending and revenues based on bottom-up  estimates, it also furthers the authorities’ goal of moving Indian fiscal policy into a medium term timeframe.  
16. Attaining these goals will be challenging. With tax reforms intended to be revenue  neutral, capital spending slated to increase given India’s infrastructure demands, as well as  the country’s pressing social needs, fiscal consolidation must rest on tight control of  nonproductive expenditure. Fund research also suggests that current expenditure has a lower  multiplier than tax or development expenditure.11Spending on interest, defense and transfers  
11 Guimarães, Roberto, 2010, “What are the effects of fiscal policy shocks in India?”, IMF Working Paper,  forthcoming  
46  
to states, areas where cuts are likely off the table, accounts for 40 percent of total 2010/11  spending (Figure 2). Capital expenditure accounts for an additional 5 percent. Non-subsidy  social spending, which if streamlined would serve more people at current cost levels,  accounts for an additional 16.5 percent. Since 2004, spending in the remaining areas,  including subsidies, has risen on average by 17 percent per year. Based on Fund staff  forecasts for revenue and spending in other categories, growth in these areas would have to  fall to 13 percent between 2010/11 and 2014/15. As high as that growth rate is, it is already  likely out of reach for 2010/11 despite various one-off items that were falling off (e.g., 6th Pay Commission arrears and the farmers’ debt waiver).  
17. The recent subsidy reform is a step in the right direction. The 2010/11 budget  rationalized subsidies for fertilizers by moving the basis from reimbursement from the  product itself to its nutrient content. In June, wholesale prices for kerosene and LNG were  raised by 33 and 11 percent, respectively, while the price of diesel was raised by 5 percent,  though the government reserved the right to reverse these measures if international oil prices  climb to excessive levels. Gasoline prices were fully liberalized with immediate effect, and  the government announced its intention to follow up with a freeing of diesel prices. All these  measures have long been supported by the Fund. Raising these prices reduced the likely  subsidy bill for the remainder of 2010/11, while the full liberalization of gasoline, and  eventually diesel prices, will reduce the variability of subsidies in the future, reducing  ongoing fiscal risks. With fertilizer and fuel subsidies still likely to cost 1.2 percent of GDP  in 2010/11, a substantial reduction in these outflows would be an important contribution to  fiscal consolidation.

ANNEX 4. CURRENT ACCOUNT AND EXTERNAL STABILITY1 
1. India’s current account deficit has widened since mid-2009, as the domestic  recovery gathered momentum. The current account deficit (CAD), which averaged  1.1 percent of GDP in the three years prior to the crisis, increased to 3.7 percent of GDP in  2010Q2. The CAD is expected to remain at 3-3.5 percent of GDP over the next couple of  years as trading partners’ demand is projected to grow by less than India’s domestic demand.  Moreover, India’s investment is anticipated to continue to increase, partly due to a big  infrastructure push.  
2. India’s CAD has been primarily the  result of the trade deficit. The trade deficit,  2.0 
which has hovered around 9 percent of GDP,  has been partly offset by the surplus in the  
1.5 
services balance (about 3 percent of GDP) and  1.0 
net factor income including transfers (about  3 percent of GDP). Despite some recent  
0.5 
moderation, export growth has remained  0.0 
resilient and has averaged 28 percent so far in

rapid growth in India’s trading partners, and a  
diversified export base, both in terms of destination markets and products.2 Import growth,  meanwhile, has also been rapid, particularly of capital goods. In terms of secular trends,  India exports have risen as a share of world exports (goods and services), reflecting gains in  productivity and increased integration with the global economy.  
3. The rise in the current account deficit has been accompanied by a domestic  investment boom. India’s domestic recovery has been led by investment. Trends since  2005 also show that the rise in the investment to GDP ratio has been accompanied by a  widening CAD. Gross fixed investment rose from 31 percent of GDP in 2006/07 (when the  
CAD was 1 percent of GDP) to 32½ percent in 2009/10, as the CAD rose to nearly 3 percent  of GDP. Further, domestic consumption growth has remained subdued, and the consumption  share of GDP has been declining steadily since the early 1990s to 57 percent of GDP in  2009/10, almost 9 percentage points below the level recorded in 2004.

4. The external debt sustainability analysis (ext-DSA) provides a benchmark to  gauge the sustainability of the CAD. Given India’s low external debt (about 20 percent of  GDP), the non-interest CAD that stabilizes external debt is in the order of 4 percent of GDP,  compared to a non-interest CAD of 2.2 percent in 2009/10. While the baseline ext-DSA  provides a useful benchmark, it does not take fully into account the potential perverse  dynamics that often arise when countries run large and protracted CADs. For instance,  interest rates on the external debt generally spike as domestic growth slows unexpectedly  due to an adverse external shock. In India’s case, given the high average growth and low  external debt, even a combination of adverse shocks would still leave external debt under  30 percent of GDP.  
5. India’s CAD is at present broadly in line with its norm. Since it is the equilibrium  level of the CA consistent with medium-term fundamentals (such as relative growth,  demographic trends, and fiscal position), the CA norm posits the level of current account  that can be financed by capital flows with no reserve accumulation and an exchange rate in  equilibrium. The fall 2010 CGER estimates India’s CAD norm at 3.4 percent of GDP.3 While the projected CAD is expected to be close to the norm in 2010/11 and 2011/12 at  around 3.3-3.5 percent of GDP,4 over the medium term the CAD is expected to decline to  2-2.5 percent of GDP as import growth moderates in line with overall economic growth and  productivity gains in the tradable sector further spur export growth.  
6. India’s CAD is particularly sensitive to oil prices and growth differentials. The  income elasticity of the trade balance is higher in the case of foreign income compared with  domestic income, based on an error-correction model (ECM) estimated for 1980-2009. The  sensitivity of the current account balance to oil prices is large: a $10 increase in oil prices  (about 12 percent) would lead to an increase in the CAD of about 0.6 percent of GDP. A    
3 This suggests that according to the macroeconomic balance approach, the real effective rupee is slightly  undervalued, but the average of estimates in the CGER suggests that the rupee is in equilibrium.  
4 The projections are broadly in line with the mean of Consensus Forecasts released in November, which show a  deficit of 3.3 (3.5) percent of GDP in 2010/11 (2011/12). 
49  
10 percent depreciation of the rupee is  estimated to lower the trade balance by 0.2  percent of GDP in 1½-2 years.

recent CADs and has proved resilient during  the global crisis. With India’s high growth  continuing to attract significant FDI  
FDI as percentage of current account deficit current account in percent of GDP (right scale) 
inflows,5 FDI could finance a third of India’s CAD, even if the latter were to remain in the  range of 3-4 percent of GDP. Portfolio equity investment has financed about a third of the  CAD in recent years, but has been more volatile than FDI. Despite occasional spikes in  volatility, FDI and portfolio equity inflows should remain strong over the medium term, as  India’s growth should continue to outpace that of the rest of the world.  
8. Although India’s CAD is expected to be more than fully financed by projected  capital inflows, a reversal of the latter could lead to disruptive adjustments. Capital  flow volatility, particularly in $ terms, has increased, which could lead to sizable  adjustments in domestic investment in the case of a sudden stop in inflows or large outflows  as in 2008/09. Portfolio equity flows have been strongly associated with investment, and a  decline in inflows would likely lead to a decline in investment and overall activity growth.6 In the case of a sudden stop in capital inflows, reserves could be used and the exchange rate  could provide some relief, as a depreciation of the rupee would help reduce the trade deficit.  However, the effect of the REER on the trade balance is relatively small and would take  time to materialize.  
9. Several indicators suggest that India’s external vulnerability compares well to  other emerging markets. India has a high reserve coverage (182 percent of short-term debt  and current account deficit), low external debt (94 percent of exports), small private external  debt (15 percent of GDP), and close to equilibrium REER. While India’s vulnerability  seemslow, it is difficult to assess the likelihood of a sudden stop in capital flows.

6 Simple vector autoregressions suggest that a 1 percent of GDP portfolio equity outflow leads to a 2 ppt decline  in investment growth.

ANNEX 5. FINANCIAL STABILITY AND REFORMS1 
Financial soundness indicators  
1. The deterioration in banks’ asset quality since the financial crisis has been  
contained. The gross nonperforming assets  (NPA) ratio edged up to 2.4 percent in  
40 
2009/10 from 2.3 percent in 2008/09, but  
35 
less than earlier anticipated. This NPA  
30 
ratio does not take into account a special  
25 
allowance for banks to restructure some

15 
loans (which amounted to less than  10 
3 percent of total loans), introduced by  5

2. Any further upturn in the NPA ratio is likely to be modest. The authorities  estimate that about 15 percent of restructured loans may eventually turn nonperforming, less  
than earlier expected. Indian banks’  exposure is largely to the corporate  
7 
sector, so the NPA level closely reflects

institutions (MFIs) in loan collection may have a negative impact on banks’ asset quality, but  banks’ exposure to MFIs is only 0.2 percent of total credit. A bigger risk would be a general  deterioration in credit culture if MFI borrowers were allowed to stop repayments.  
3. The banking system remains well-capitalized. The capital adequacy ratio (CAR)  for all scheduled commercial banks rose to 14.5 percent in 2009/10 from 14 percent (Basel II  calculations) in 2008/09, well above the required 9 percent2. Tier I capital makes up  70 percent of total capital and does not include items to be deducted under the newly  
1 Prepared by Xiaoyong Wu.

announced Basel III capital framework, entailing that implementation of Basel III would  have little immediate impact on Indian banks3. A quantitative impact study conducted by the  Basel Committee, in which ten large Indian banks participated, showed that Indian banks  would not likely be stressed by the implementation of the new capital standards.  
4. Staff’s stress tests indicate that the CAR for the top 30 banks would remain  above the RBI’s regulatory  2384298304956
minimum even under a scenario  
of a doubling of NPAs from their  
March 2010 level. The CAR of a  
few small public sector banks  
(PSBs), however, would fall below  
the 12 percent intended by the  
government. Foreign banks in the  
sample reported large increases in  
NPAs during the financial crisis,  
and a further 100 percent increase in  
NPAs would increase their NPA  
ratio by another 4 percentage points.  
5. PSBs would need to raise new capital to support credit growth over the medium  term even without the increase in NPAs assumed in the stress tests. At a credit growth  rate of 15 percent, PSBs will require some 3 percent of 2010/11 GDP in new capital in the  next five years to maintain a CAR of 9 percent under the Basel II framework. The capital  requirement rises to 4.3 percent of 2010/11 GDP if the PSBs maintain a CAR of 12 percent.  The government, however, has already embarked on recapitalizing the PSBs, supported by a  
$2 billion loan from the World bank and is  considering injecting additional funds.  
6. Bank lending has rebounded with  increased wholesale funding. Bank loans  rose 19 percent (y/y) in Q3 2010 compared  
with 12 percent in Q4 2009. With deposit  growth not keeping pace, the loan-to-deposit  ratio has risen. Banks are raising more funds

investors: CDs now account for 7 percent of total deposits compared to 4 percent in 2008.  
3 Under Basel III, capital quality standards will be tightened and a new capital conservation buffer will be  introduced, but the minimum total capital plus conservation buffer will remain at 8 percent until 2015, with a  phased increase to 10.5 percent at the beginning of 2019.

7. The financial crisis has had some negative impact on banking profitability. Banks’ return on equity (ROE) declined to 14.3 percent in 2009/10 from 15.4 percent in  2008/09. Income from securities and foreign currency trading fell considerably as a result of  the financial crisis, but the decline was partially offset by growth in other operating income.  The net interest margin remained broadly unchanged during 2009/10. Nevertheless, banks’  interest expense are on the rise with the recent upturn in deposit rates and the accrual of  interest on savings deposits on a daily basis from April 2010. In addition, banks’  provisioning coverage for NPAs was at 52 percent at the end of March 2010, and the  increase in the provisioning requirement to 70 percent by September 2010 would have put  additional pressure on banks’ profit margins.  
Risks to the outlook  
8. Credit risk remains the main risk in the banking system. The credit cycle is just at  the beginning, but some special provisions to stimulate infrastructure financing could result  in lower lending standards. The transition to Basel II, which has raised the CAR for banks by  lowering the risk weights based on external credit ratings, may also give banks a false sense  of strength in their balance sheet and encourage increased risk-taking.

to be temporary if banks are successful in  
attracting deposits after having raised deposit rates and lending for residential mortgages may  slow after the recent RBI’s measures (see below).  
10. Interconnectedness of banks, MFs, and nonbank financial companies (NBFCs)  has a bearing on funding risks. About two-thirds of MF assets are invested in debt  securities, of which about half are bank CDs. MFs also purchase CPs and bonds issued by  NBFCs—which include leasing companies, housing finance companies, mortgage guarantee  companies and infrastructure finance companies. Therefore, large outflows from mutual  funds could cause funding strains for both banks and NBFCs. In addition, NBFCs also  borrow from banks, and strains in the wholesale market could have negative effect on banks’  asset quality if NBFCs encountered repayment difficulties.  
53  
Reform initiatives  
11. The authorities have implemented countercyclical capital and provisioning  requirements. At the onset of the crisis, risk weights and provisioning ratios were lowered  on credits to sectors including housing, capital markets and commercial real estate. As the  economic recovery took hold, the provisioning ratio on loans to commercial real estate was  raised from 0.4 percent to 1 percent.  
12. The latest macroprudential measures are aimed at the housing sector. These  include the introduction of an 80 percent cap on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on mortgages,  and an increase in the risk weights to 125 percent from 100 percent on mortgages of Rs 7.5  million or more. Also, the provisioning on standard assets has been raised to 2 percent for  mortgages with “teaser interest rates”, loans with an initial low interest rate followed by  higher rates later.  
13. Facilitating infrastructure investment has been a financial reform priority. More  than 80 percent of infrastructure projects are financed by PSBs, which face increasing  asset/liability mismatches because of the extended maturity of infrastructure loans. To  address this issue and provide more infrastructure financing, the India Infrastructure Finance  Co. Ltd. (IIFCL) has implemented a Takeout Financing Scheme to purchase infrastructure  loans from PSBs. The IIFCL is also considering plans to provide guarantees for bond issued  by infrastructure companies. In addition, the authorities have taken several other measures to  enhance infrastructure financing:  
· A new category of institutions, called NBFC-IFCs, were created, with a minimum of  75 percent of its total assets deployed in infrastructure loans. These NBFCs were  allowed to issue tax exempt bonds.  
· In September 2010, the limit on foreign investment in corporate bonds was lifted  from $15 billion to $20 billion, with the increment reserved for infrastructure  company bonds with a residual maturity exceeding 5 years.  
· Commercial banks were allowed not to mark to market bonds issued by infrastructure  companies with a minimum residual maturity of seven years.  
· Banks were allowed to classify a loan as standard for a maximum of four years  (instead of two) if the infrastructure project cannot start operation on the due date.  · The provisioning ratio was reduced from 20 percent to 15 percent for infrastructure  loans classified as sub-standard for which banks have a clear and legal first claim on  the cash flows of the projects.  
· The risk weights of banks’ exposures to well-rated NBFC-IFCs were lowered by  linking the risk weights to ratings assigned by rating agencies.  
· The 2010/11 Budget introduced a deduction of an additional amount of Rs. 20,000 on  tax savings for investment in long-term infrastructure bonds. 
54  
14. The corporate bond and CP market has expanded quickly. Growth in corporate  bond and CP issuance has outpaced credit growth in recent years partly in response to the  authorities’ reform initiatives, including listing and reporting requirements, higher FII  
participation, and repos with corporate bonds.  The amount of listed corporate bonds has  risen 58 percent since December 2008, while  outstanding CP has almost tripled, with  higher trading volumes. Corporate bond  issuance is dominated by highly-rated  companies, especially public sector ones, and  liquidity is limited. Domestic institutional  investors’ participation remains low and  issues surrounding stamp duties and

15. Supervision of financial conglomerates is being strengthened. A mechanism for  monitoring financial conglomerates has been in place since 2004, and the RBI has started  quarterly on-site inspections using the CAMELS framework. An enhanced revised off-site  reporting system has been introduced. Financial conglomerates are now required to deduct  from their capital investments in excess of 20 percent of a subsidiary’s equity, compared with  a previous 30 percent. To prevent regulatory arbitrage, the RBI is seeking convergence of  regulation of banks and financial conglomerates.  
16. The RBI has issued a discussion paper on new banking licenses. The paper  discusses the pros and cons of licensing new banks, allowing the conversion of NBFCs into  banks and allowing large industrial houses to own banks. There are safety, soundness and  legal concerns with non-financial companies owning banks, and the ability to supervise the  banking activity of non-financial companies will be critical. A proper supervisory structure  would be essential, one that requires banking activities of the non-financial group be  conducted within a tiered holding company subject to prudential regulation with thick  firewalls between its banking activities and the group’s other activities.  
17. Regulatory reform is moving forward. Following up on the authorities’ 2009 self assessment on financial stability, the authorities announced in the 2010/2011 budget a  Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission to rewrite and streamline financial sector  laws. The government has also proposed a Financial Stability and Development Council  (FSDC) chaired by the Finance Minister to deal with inter-regulatory coordination, financial  stability as well as financial development issues. Close consultation with financial regulators  would be important to dispel any concern about regulatory independence.

ANNEX 6. INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE: INDIAN CHALLENGES AND COUNTRY EXPERIENCES India’s Infrastructure: Plans and Challenges  
1. Increased investment in infrastructure is one of the government’s top policy  priorities. India’s 11th Plan (2007/08 to 2011/12) specifies a large increase in infrastructure  investment among its major goals:  
The Eleventh Plan (2007-08 to 2011-12) aims at a sustainable growth rate of  9 per cent with emphasis on a broad-based and inclusive approach that would  improve the quality of life and reduce disparities across regions and  communities. There is consensus that infrastructure inadequacies would  constitute a significant constraint in realising this development potential. To  overcome this constraint, an ambitious programme of infrastructure  investment, involving both public and private sector, is being developed for  the Eleventh Plan.1 
Composition of Infrastructure Spending  (Eleventh Plan)

2. The 11th Plan aimed at a large shift toward  infrastructure investment. During the period of the  10th Plan, infrastructure investment totaled 5.1 percent

of GDP. A goal of the 11th Plan is to raise this to  7.6 percent of GDP, a total which would now exceed the  US$500 billion target announced at the beginning of the  Plan. With energy shortages a problem in much of the  country and poor transportation infrastructure a major  impediment to investment, these two sectors were the  two main

in electricity, including generation and  transmission, was slated to account for a third of  infrastructure investment. Roads and railways  would account for another quarter. With such  large investments envisaged, and with little fiscal  space available, the Planning Commission (PC)  also aimed for increased private sector  participation in infrastructure finance, with a goal  set of ensuring 1/3 private participation in most  categories.

3. Progress has been uneven across sectors. The authorities published a Mid-Term  Appraisal of the 11th Plan in mid-2010. With final data available for 2007/08 and 2008/09,  overall infrastructure investment exceeded original targets by a small margin. But private  investment in telecommunications greatly exceeded the original targets, while investment in  roads was disappointing. Moreover, costs in many areas were higher than originally forecast,  mainly due to difficulties with land acquisition and higher capital equipment prices. Despite  the overperformance in investment in power generation capacity, the output target of 78.7  GW has now been reduced to 62 GW.  
4. A further acceleration of infrastructure investment is envisaged for the remainder  of the 11th Plan, and the 12th Plan. To reach the revised 11th Plan targets, infrastructure  investment would likely have to rise from an estimated 7.2 percent of GDP in 2008/09 to  around 8.4 percent of GDP in 2011/12, the final year of the 11th Plan. Additionally, a target  of US$ 1 trillion for infrastructure has been widely discussed for the next Plan, likely  entailing infrastructure investment of 9-10 percent of GDP.  
5. There are roadblocks in the way of this acceleration of investment. Several reports  share many findings, such as:  
· Finance. The focus on private sector involvement in the 11th Plan has laid bare the  difficulty of financing large infrastructure projects, given India’s bank-dominated  financial system, shallow corporate debt market, capital account controls, and fiscal  dominance. The main constraint is the availability of long-term rupee debt financing  which so far has been provided by banks, exposing them to maturity mismatches. The  authorities have begun to address these constraints (see Annex 5 for recent measures). 
· Public sector capacity. Many areas where infrastructure investment has lagged  under the 11th Plan (e.g., railway stations, ports, roads) are areas in which PPPs have  been successful in other countries. India has a broad PPP program, but the  authorities’ execution capacity has reportedly been a constraint at times. 
· Government clearances. Overlapping levels of government and a wide array of  public sector stakeholders have added to implementation risks. Some states, such as  Tamil Nadu, have moved to simplify procedures and unify oversight into a single  office, but such progress has not been broadly imitated. 
· Land acquisition. Government clearances can be particularly difficult to obtain  where land acquisition is involved, with numerous restrictions related to  environmental, social, political and economic concerns each requiring separate  settlement, sometimes in legal settings. This greatly adds to implementation risk of  projects and discourages foreign companies from entry. A bill in Parliament to  address this has been stalled for some time. 
· Limited capacity of contractors. There are few domestic companies in India with  the capacity to engage in very large infrastructure projects, and many of which are  subsidiaries of large diversified conglomerates, concentrating risks. Smaller  construction companies face difficulties in hiring skilled labor, dealing with  regulatory complexity and access to finance, while foreign companies are  discouraged by regulatory and implementation risk.

Cross Country Analysis  
6. An IMF staff study looks at how other emerging markets have financed  infrastructure investments2. Have countries financed large infrastructure booms via  domestic savings? And if so what has been the role of public versus private savings? If not,  have some countries relied to a large extent on foreign capital? What type of capital financed  infrastructure? Did countries rely more on banks or on capital markets? These are some of  the questions that the study attempts to find answers to. It does so in two parts: in the first,  the study analyzes the behavior of the main macroeconomic variables at times when  countries experienced infrastructure booms. This is based on a large data set, including 105  countries and spanning 1980 to 2009. The second part consists of four case studies of Brazil,  Chile, China, and Korea and aims at providing more insights into the type of financial  instruments used.  
Cross Country Macro  
7. A first pass through the data identifies booms in infrastructure investment and  looks at the macroeconomic conditions preceding and during such booms. Highways and  electricity generation are two focal areas for India’s infrastructure push and are also areas in  which the outputs to investment, namely roads and electrical generation capacity, are easily  available3. Booms are identified as three-year periods during which the growth in mileage of  paved roads or installed electrical generation capacity exceeded the unconditional 1980-2009  average by significantly more than 1 standard deviation for roads or ½ standard deviation for  energy. Assessing whether macroeconomic variables during those periods also differed  significantly from their long-run means provides some indication of how infrastructure  booms are financed.  
8. Across many countries, especially developing countries, large investments in  infrastructure are preceded by periods of rapid growth. Rapid growth leads to strains on  energy capacity, driving investment in additional generation. To a lesser extent the same is  true with road construction. Similarly, and as other studies have found, growth is  significantly higher in periods after such large investments in energy and roads.  
9. Energy generation investment is not associated with deteriorating current account  positions, while this is more common for road construction. Investment in energy  generation is generally preceded by strong current account performance, and balances do not  tend to worsen during periods of investment, implying that domestic savings are the marginal  source for finance. Roads investment also tends to be preceded by strong current account  balances, but, for investment in highways, it would appear that foreign savings are more  likely to be tapped, or perhaps that there is more reallocation of domestic savings.  
2 C. Park, J.P. Walsh and J. Yu (2010), “Financing Infrastructure in Emerging Markets,” manuscript.  
3 For roads the indicator used is mileage of paved roads, which may be problematic in developed economies  where roads investment is focused on upgrades to already paved roads rather than new construction. 
58  
10. Public financing, particularly deficit finance, is important in energy investment. Booms in energy generation capacity tend to follow periods of improving fiscal balances,  presumably as rapid growth fills government coffers, though this improvement tends to  dissipate during the boom as capital spending rises. For roads the story is somewhat  different: roads investment also tends to lag periods of superior fiscal performance, but roads  do not lead to deficit financing. What seems likely is that energy generation is more of a  political priority than roads or private investors are more likely to invest in roads than in  power generation, leaving the latter to the public.  
11. Periods of rapid investment in energy and roads capacity do not appear to be  linked to periods of unusual expansion of credit, either from banks or in debt markets. This means only that such infrastructure booms do not lead to appreciable financial  deepening: either the resources harnessed by the private sector are relatively small on  average, or they are diverted from other areas. This diversion could be beneficial, as the  returns to infrastructure investment could be quite high if growth constraints are what lead to  the boom.  
12. A closer look at how four other emerging market countries have financed  infrastructure shows highly heterogeneous experiences. The effects discussed above are  averages across countries, and conceal important differences in how countries have  addressed the issue of infrastructure constraints. The lack of significance of private sector  financial variables is also somewhat disappointing, given the focus in many countries on  additional private sector involvement in infrastructure. Staff analysis therefore looked in  detail at how Brazil, Chile, China and Korea have financed infrastructure investment.  
Case Studies  
Brazil  
13. Long-term finance in Brazil relies substantially on the national development bank,  BNDES. High interest rates and a legacy of Brazil’s historically high inflation complicate  long-term borrowing despite a sophisticated financial system. Much long-term lending is  therefore done through BNDES, which is state-owned. BNDES, with some input from the  government, sets lending rates for a wide variety of infrastructure projects. The base rate for  these loans is well below even short-term market rates, and can be changed to direct lending.  As part of a current program to build up infrastructure before the 2014 World Cup and 2016  Summer Olympics, a decision was made to reduce lending spreads to various infrastructure  sectors in order to stimulate lending. However, concerns have been raised by many that the  dominance of a state-owned (and taxpayer-subsidized) lender in long-term financing has  distorted the financial sector and slowed the development of a more traditional long-term  debt market.  
14. While the energy sector is fragmented, state-run Elétrobras is the dominant  generator. Most electricity generation is hydroelectric, and Elétrobras is the largest operator  of hydro plants. It also dominates generation and transmission directly and through  subsidiaries, and has recently begun to invest abroad. The government holds 52 percent of 
59  
common shares, but Elétrobras is listed in Sao Paulo, New York, and Madrid, and issues debt  both domestically and internationally. Private investments by other companies have not been  as profitable as those of Elétrobras, though the government hopes the faster pace of economic  growth as well as the recent cuts to BNDES lending rates will change this in the future.  
15. The private sector has become more influential in financing highway construction  in recent years. Around 8 percent of national highways are now run by concessionaires on a  for-profit basis, though these are concentrated in the richest and most developed parts of the  country. In 2004 the government passed a law allowing joint public-private financing of  
infrastructure investment, which despite some roadblocks, have also been successful,  particularly at the state level and with railroads. Concessionaires tend to be active issuers of  stock and some concessions have been attractive to foreign investors. Debt finance, however,  remains dominated by BNDES, with bank financing generally limited to short-term or trade  finance. Multilateral lending has also been an important source of long-term debt funding.  
Chile  
16. Chile’s pro-business environment and successive waves of financial liberalization  have led to infrastructure investment dominated by the private sector. Chile’s influential  privatized pension system funneled workers’ savings into asset managers, leading to rapid  growth in its equity market (with a capitalization now at 144 percent of GDP), long-term  debt market, and insurance industry. Assets under management by the pension funds totaled  65 percent of GDP in 2009, while the insurance industry held an additional 22 percent. The  government’s transparency and openness have also made it a favored destination for foreign  investment.  
17. The energy sector is entirely privatized, with extensive foreign participation. Both  generation and transmission are effectively controlled by a small number of large companies.  During Chile’s period of rapid growth in the 1990s, the country’s pension funds were a  crucial source of funds for equity issuance, but in more recent years the increasing presence  of strategic foreign investors from Europe and North America has reduced most companies’  floats. These companies are also active issuers of debt in Chile’s corporate bond market.  With investment grade credit ratings, domestic issues are mostly purchased by insurance  companies and pension funds, but firms also issue in international markets.  
18. Roads construction and upgrading is largely done through PPPs. Beginning in the  1990s, when the country upgraded the main north-south highway, PPPs have become a  routine way for the government to build and upgrade major roads across the country. While  few PPPs have run into financial difficulties, the large size of the program led the  government to disclose the contingent liabilities of these programs in the budget, based on a  sophisticated analysis of possible cash flows. PPPs attract substantial FDI, both at the initial  phase and later on as construction companies have sold their contracts to outside investors.  But the main source of financing has been via debt, which Chilean companies have generally  wrapped by foreign monoline insurers policies to broaden the range of possible investors. 
60  
China  
19. The state-run financial system has been the primary source of finance for  infrastructure investment. Banks devote large shares of their loan portfolios (ranging from  18 up to 40 percent) to investments in infrastructure and one bank, the China Development  Bank, is focused largely (74 percent of assets) on investments in that area. Corporate bonds,  often with credit guarantees provided by banks or other entities, have become more  important in recent years. Local governments, which finance themselves via usage fees on  land (land premium) that rise as infrastructure improves, also guarantee much infrastructure  lending.  
20. Energy generation is dominated by five state-owned enterprises, but there are many  small private companies as well. Smaller companies are active in the equity market, but  large-scale investments by SOEs tend to be bank financed. In general, investment in energy  generation has not been profitable, as input costs, such as coal, have been liberalized more  than user rates. Government regulation and the difficulty of obtaining permits have also  complicated private investment in energy.  
21. A boom in roads has been catalyzed by local governments. With much of their  revenue coming from land premiums, local governments in China have tried to channel  funding into roads. Around one third of funding for road construction comes from local  governments directly, while another third comes from bank loans. Private SPVs have also  
become quite large in some cases, with many issuing debt in local markets and 20 now listed  on equity exchanges.  
Korea  
22. While Korea’s financial sector is large and sophisticated, infrastructure investment  remains largely a public-sector phenomenon. Infrastructure investment grew rapidly during  the country’s sustained boom from the 1960s to 1980s, but has tapered off in recent years. In  1994, a law was passed to facilitate private investment in infrastructure projects, but its  
coverage was limited. Following an amendment in 1999, private involvement in  infrastructure rose to around 20 percent of the total.  
23. The Korean Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) dominates the energy sector. KEPCO was fully state-owned from 1981 to 1989, when 21 percent of shares were sold. The  company actively issues stock, but there are restrictions of the number of shares foreigners  can buy, as well as a legal requirement that the share of government ownership not fall below  51 percent. Such a large company has access to the full array of financing sources, and  KEPCO also actively issues investment-grade debt domestically and abroad.  
24. Until recently, highway construction was undertaken almost entirely by public  sector entities. The Korean highway network expanded rapidly during the 1960s, financed  almost entirely by a national highway corporation which borrowed money from banks and  multilateral lenders, as well as by issuing sovereign-backed bonds. Another boom occurred  during the 2000s, but with greater use of bond issuance, both domestic and international. 
61  
With the improved environment for private participation, around one quarter of the mileage  added during this period was built by private companies, some of which enjoyed support  from a public infrastructure fund.  
Lessons for India  
25. Large infrastructure needs can be met domestically, though foreign participation  can be beneficial. Capacity increases such as India envisages for the remainder of the 11th Plan and the 12th Plan have in many countries been accommodated within a country’s  domestic savings envelope, particularly for energy investments. But companies like KEPCO  and Elétrobras have used international debt issues to finance infrastructure investments  (Elétrobras also has foreign listings to raise equity finance abroad), and FDI has been an  important source of funding for roads and energy in Chile.  
26. Private funds can be catalyzed into infrastructure investment in a variety of ways. With fiscal space relatively scarce, India will have to improve the environment for private  sector investment in infrastructure. Fiscal resources can be leveraged via guarantees, as local  governments in China do with bank loans for infrastructure projects, or via PPPs, as Chile  has done. China and Brazil also both use public financial enterprises to channel lending into  infrastructure projects, though this can create other problems. BNDES’ dominance of the  long-term lending market in Brazil worries many observers, and the concentration of lending  risk in infrastructure in China may raise financial risks.  
27. The business climate for private investment is also very important. In China, private  investment in energy has been slowed by government red tape and the varying pace of price  liberalization across different markets. In Korea, the PPP industry did not take off until the  government passed laws that broadened the scope of the original legislation. Chile has been  extremely successful at mobilizing private finance for infrastructure, but a World Economic  Forum report on its successes cited not only its open equity market, relatively well-developed  corporate bond sector and general economic stability but also its “extremely well-developed  e-government services, clear information on policy changes, transparency and openness of  statistics publications, and dialogue and decision-making process.”

ANNEX 7. WHAT IS THE OUTLOOK FOR PRIVATE SAVING IN INDIA? EVIDENCE FROM  DYNAMIC MACRO PANELS1 
1. India’s private saving has risen  sharply since the early 2000s. The increase  
0 
4
in India’s saving ratio is sizable when  0 
3
compared against a large panel of emerging  
0 
and advanced economies. Private saving  2
increased from 24 percent of GDP in 2000 to  
0 
1
35 percent of GDP in 2009. This has  
0 
coincided with the rise in investment, and  more recently with the acceleration in  growth.

2. Since investment is forecast to continue to grow faster than GDP, understanding  the determinants of private saving is key to assess the extent to which India will need to  
tap foreign saving to finance investment.  While the current account deficit has widened  
0 
4
in recent years, several factors point to a  0 
3
continuation of rising private saving, at least  over the medium term. First, India’s saving  
0 
2
will continue to benefit from the increase in  
0 
1
the working-age dependency ratio. Growth in  0 
income should help increase the overall  saving ratio as many households surpass their  subsistence level of consumption. The effects

Private saving rate(% of GDP) Public saving rate(% of GDP)

of other factors can only be determined empirically. For instance, private saving may decline  as a result of fiscal consolidation, but this will depend on the extent to which Ricardian  equivalence holds. For example, in a country with low debt levels (and a low Ricardian  offset) a 1 percent of GDP decline in public saving is likely to lead to less than 1 percent of  GDP increase in private saving, which would contribute to an overall decline in national saving. In the case of a highly indebted country, the increase in private saving may match the  decline in public saving, with no effect on national saving.  
3. To shed light on the determinants of private saving in India, we estimate a  dynamic panel regression covering 130 countries spanning the period 1970-2009. The  empirical model posits that private saving is determined by its lagged value (to account for  the persistence of macroeconomic variables), GDP per capita, growth in GDP per capita,

63  
public saving (to assess the extent of “Ricardian offset”), young-age dependency ratio, old age dependency ratio, life expectancy, real interest rate, financial development, terms of  trade, and other variables, including proxies for macroeconomic stability, as well as time and country-fixed effects. 2 The times series results for India justify the use of panel data  since the former yield mostly insignificant coefficients, likely because of the short time span  and persistence in the data. Despite considerable macroeconomic heterogeneity in such a  large panel of countries, the panel regression estimates are much more precise and robust.  The baseline results (full panel sample) are presented in the table below.

4. The results are relatively robust and conform to life-cycle theories of  consumption and saving. The key findings include:  
2 The data are from the IMF’s WEO and the World Bank’s WDI. The variable selection is based on traditional  theories of consumption. 
64  
· Demographic variables exert significant influence on private saving. For example, a  1 percentage point decrease in young-age (old) dependency ratio increase private  saving by 0.2 (0.6) percentage points.  
· The effect of fiscal policies on private saving is also important, but the results do not  support Ricardian equivalence: a 1 percentage point decrease in public saving  increases private saving by about 0.5 percentage points. The effect is significantly  larger for countries with large public debt, meaning that for highly-indebted countries  an increase in the fiscal deficit is almost fully offset by a concomitant increase in  private saving.  
· Interest rates generally have a small effect on saving and, consistent with other  findings, the effect of financial development is generally ambiguous and statistically  insignificant.  
· Considerable macroeconomic heterogeneity is uncovered. For instance, the quantile  regression estimates show that the impact of public saving and demographic ratios on  private saving are larger for low-savers.  
5. The empirical model indicates that the rise in private saving in India could  continue for 5-10 years. According to these baseline projections, India’s saving rate could  increase by further 2-4 percentage points over the next 10 years as it would continue to  benefit from favorable demographics for two more decades. However, simple conditional  forecasts (assuming most regressors are constant at their end point value) point to a  moderation of the recent trend. The projection assumes constant growth in GDP per capita,  and an unchanged level of public saving. On balance, the envisaged fiscal consolidation  should help increase national saving, but according to the empirical model, the effect of  consolidation would be partly offset by private saving.

ANNEX I: INDIA—MEDIUM-TERM PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS 
Macroeconomic Assumptions. India’s recovery from the economic crisis is well underway,  with growth forecast at 8 ¾ percent in 2010/11 led by infrastructure investment, but returning  to trend, 8 percent, in 2011/12. Inflation is relatively high, falling only to 6½ percent by end 2010/11, and falling gradually to 4 percent thereafter.  
Fiscal Assumptions. Consolidation is underway, with the budget deficit of the general  government expected to fall from 10½ percent of GDP in 2009/10 to 9½ of GDP in 2010/11,  falling gradually in the medium term. The main operating assumptions are:  
· Tax revenues will revive in 2010/11 as the economy returns to trend and will remain  strong in the medium term as more of the economy shifts into the formal sector.  · The delayed Goods and Services Tax and new Direct Tax Code will be implemented  
in 2012/13, contributing through efficiency gains to greater collections.  · Spending growth will be strong in the near term, but over the course of the sample  period be kept slightly below nominal GDP growth, contributing around 1/3 of the  total fiscal consolidation during the sample period.  
A. Sensitivity Analysis  
Debt Path. General government debt would fall to 68 percent of GDP by 2015/16 from  77 percent of GDP in 2009/10. This downward trend is robust under most shocks. With little  debt denominated in foreign currency, India is not vulnerable to shifts in exchange rates, and  interest-rate sensitivity is also only a small risk given the long duration of its debt.  
Other scenarios. A shock to growth in the near term would substantially slow consolidation  and keep debt at close to current levels in the medium term. A need to finance contingent  liabilities during the middle of the consolidation process would push debt above 2009/10  levels. In both cases, confidence could be damaged. The no policy change scenario presents a  worse trajectory, but by assuming that the primary balance remains the same, it effectively  assumes no recovery in revenues from crisis levels while this recovery is already underway.  
Policy Risks. The authorities have ambitious consolidation goals. As described in the staff  report, restraining spending could be challenging. Contingent liabilities, such as those  stemming from PPPs, as well as the need to provide capital for public sector banks, could be  a risk. While there is potential for higher revenues and disinvestment proceeds, these are  more likely to be spent than to contribute to debt reduction.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:  
As per the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER),  the exchange rate in India is classified as floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined  in the interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes at times. The RBI’s  role is to modulate excessive volatility so as to maintain orderly conditions. On August 20, 1994,  India accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of  Agreement. India maintains the following restrictions on the making of payments and transfers  for current international transactions, which are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII,  Section 2(a): restrictions related to the nontransferability of balances under the India-Russia debt  agreement; restrictions arising from unsettled balances under inoperative bilateral payments  arrangements with two Eastern European countries; and a restriction on the transfer of  amortization payments on loans by non-resident relatives. The Executive Board has not approved  these restrictions.

ANNEX IV: INDIA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP 
In Bank FY2010 (July 1-June 30), IBRD/IDA lending totaled $9.31 billion, markedly above  the $2.24 billion in FY2009. IFC committed $1.8 billion in FY2010, up from $947 million in  FY2009. The World Bank Group’s (WBG) Country Strategy (CAS) for India for 2009-2012  focuses on helping India to fast-track the development of much-needed infrastructure and to  support the seven poorest states in achieving higher standards of living for their people. The  strategy envisaged a total proposed International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  
(IBRD) lending program of US$14.6 billion for the four-year CAS period, of which  approximately $3 billion additional IBRD financing was projected for lending in response to  the financial crisis. The International Development Association (IDA) V allocation was  $4.79 billion (SDR equivalent of 2.919 billion).  
As a result of the financial crisis as well as increased Government demand for the Bank  Group’s support, the pace of IBRD lending has been faster than initially expected, bringing  India closer to its Single Borrower Limit (SBL) of $17.5 billion earlier than anticipated. This  has resulted in a revised lending scenario that projects approximately US$8 billion in IBRD  lending in FY11 and FY12. To help maintain India’s IBRD net exposure within the SBL and  ensure medium term sustainability of the India program, the Government has agreed on  purchases of IBRD Special Private Placement Bonds. IFC is also carefully managing its  exposure in India via mobilization and selectivity, and is focusing on projects with strong  development additionality. IFC’s management agreed, on an exceptional basis, to allow India  to exceed the economic capital limit set for BRIC countries  
The overarching objective of the CAS is to scale up the development impact of Bank Group  assistance to help India achieve rapid, inclusive growth and sustainable development, and  improving service delivery. It aims to do all this while strengthening weaknesses in project  implementation, improving the effectiveness of public spending, and achieving demonstrable  results to scale up the impact of World Bank assistance. The diversity of India calls for a  differentiated, tailored approach. In India’s low-income states and lagging regions in more  advanced states, the focus is on achieving the MDGs, relying primarily on IDA resources and  non-lending technical assistance (TA). In more advanced states and at the central level, the  focus is on strengthening institutions so that they can deal with emerging middle income  challenges, relying on IBRD lending and cutting-edge analytical work. IFC’s strategy  supports inclusive growth by increasing access to infrastructure and finance, focusing on  low-income, rural, and fragile regions and making climate change central to its work.  
The India Program is increasingly focused on supporting large, transformative development  programs, such as the River Basin, Rural Roads II and National Livelihoods operations,  innovative pilots such as the Karnataka Watershed and the Social Security for the  Unorganized Sector Workers operations, and the leveraging of Bank resources. The shift to a  more substantial engagement has raised the visibility and influence of the Bank Group, while  creating opportunities for greater focus on public policy and institutional reform.

ANNEX V: INDIA—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) operations in India began in 1986. Cumulative public  sector loan commitments totaled $22.3 billion as of 24 November 2010 for 139 loans. With  an additional $1.6 billion in private sector loans (the latter without government guarantee),  total loan commitments on a cumulative basis amount to $23.9 billion. These funds have  been provided from the Bank’s ordinary capital resources (OCR). Also, AsDB has  approved equity investments amounting to $0.3 billion. AsDB’s lending and equity activities  are summarized below.

AsDB's India Country Partnership Strategy (2009-2012) (CPS) is based on four strategic  pillars: (i) Support for the process of inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth;  (ii) Catalyzing investment through the use of innovative business and financing modalities;  (iii) Strengthening the results orientation of project design and implementation and  emphasizing knowledge solutions; and (iv) Support for regional cooperation. The CPS has  been designed to support Government of India's efforts in facilitating inclusive growth and  speeding up the pace of poverty reduction and social development as emphasized in the  Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-2012). It has been prepared within a results-based  framework, and aims at significantly strengthening AsDB support for infrastructure  development in the relatively poorer states of India, promoting public private partnerships in  infrastructure, supporting climate change adaptation and mitigation, and encouraging the use  of innovative financing modalities (non-sovereign loans and cofinancing) to enhance the  leverage of AsDB operations.

ANNEX VI: INDIA––STATISTICAL ISSUES 
1. Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance, but weaknesses remain in the  timeliness and coverage of certain statistical series. India has an intricate system for compiling  economic and financial statistics and produces a vast quantity of data covering most sectors of the  economy. India subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) on  December 27, 1996 and started posting its metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin  Board on October 30, 1997. It is currently in observance of the SDDS, although it uses flexibility  options for timeliness of data on general government operations and on the periodicity and  timeliness of labor market data.  
2. The data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, IMF  Country Report No. 04/96) was published in April 2004. It assesses India’s data dissemination  practices against the SDDS requirements and assesses the quality of six datasets based on the Data  Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) developed by STA.  
3. National accounts and employment statistics: The Central Statistical Organization  (CSO) releases a new series of national accounts, with base year 2004–2005 with a dissemination  lag for quarterly releases of two months. Estimates of value added in constant prices for public  administration and defense may be biased upwards, as they are based on the government’s wage  bill (with arrears counted in the year that they are paid) deflated by the Wholesale Price Index  (WPI). There are long standing deficiencies in employment data: they are only available on an  annual basis and with a substantial lag, and they only cover the formal sector, which accounts for a  small segment of the labor market.  
4. Price statistics: Since January 2006, the Labour Bureau has published a CPI for industrial  workers with a 2001 base year. A revised CPI with new weights is expected to be unveiled in early  2011. Presently, there are four CPIs, each based on the consumption basket of a narrow category of  consumers (namely industrial workers, urban and nonmanual employees, agricultural laborers, and  
rural laborers). The CPIs are published with a lag of about one month. With the exception of the  industrial workers CPI, the other indices are based on weights that are over ten years. The WPI  was also recently revised and has a 2004/05 base year. The primary articles components of the  WPI are published weekly with a lag of two weeks. Despite recent progress, real estate and  housing price data are not available on a timely basis and the geographic coverage remains limited.  
5. External sector statistics: While the concepts and definitions used to compile balance of  payments statistics are broadly in line with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5), the RBI presentation does not strictly follow the BPM5. Furthermore, trade data have  quality, valuation, timing, and coverage problems, and data on trade prices, volumes, and  composition are not regularly available on a timely basis. Only trade credit extended for more than  180 days is included in the balance of payments (and the IIP and external debt data); trade credit is  often less than 180 days in most countries. Bilateral data on services exports to the United States  and other developed countries are manifold higher than counterpart services imports published by  these same countries. External debt statistics are available on a quarterly basis with a one quarter  lag. Estimates of short-term external debt are presented in the debt statistics on an original maturity 
 13  
basis. The short-term maturity attribution on a residual maturity basis is only available annually  (and excludes residual maturity of medium- and long-term nonresident Indian accounts). The  international investment position (IIP) statistics cover the sectors prescribed in the BPM5 and these  data are disseminated within six months of the reference period in respect of annual data. Coverage  of direct investment positions data is hampered by the absence of appropriate legal or institutional  authority. India began disseminating the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign  Currency Liquidity as prescribed under the SDDS in December 2001. The more up-to-date  information on certain variables, such as total foreign reserves, foreign currency assets, gold, and  SDRs, are available on a weekly basis and are disseminated as part of a weekly statistical  supplement on the RBI web site.  
6. Monetary and financial statistics: The RBI web site and the RBI Bulletin publish a wide  array of monetary and financial statistics, including reserve money and its components, RBI’s  survey, monetary survey, liquidity aggregates (outstanding amounts), interest rates, exchange rates,  foreign reserves, and results of government securities auctions. The frequency and quality of data  dissemination have improved substantially in recent years.  
7. Concepts and definitions used by the RBI to compile monetary statistics are in broad  conformity with the guidelines provided in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual  (MFSM). Nevertheless, the following concepts and principles deviate from the MFSM. First, the  resident sector data do not provide sufficient information on the sectoral distribution of domestic  credit. Specifically, under their present sectorization scheme, the authorities subdivide the resident  nonbank sector data by (i) central government; (ii) state government; and (iii) the commercial  sector (including other financial corporations, public and other nonfinancial corporations, and  other resident sectors). Second, commercial banks add accrued interest to credit and deposit  positions on a quarterly basis only (instead of the prescribed monthly basis).  
8. The RBI reports monetary data for IFS on a regular basis. Since October 2006, the RBI has  initiated the electronic reporting of monetary data, which is a major improvement from the  previous paper-based reporting which was prone to errors and delays. India has also submitted to  STA test data (starting from December 2001 data) on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) that  have been developed to implement the methodology outlined in the MFSM. STA is working with  the authorities in resolving the outstanding data issues on the development of the SRFs.  
9. Fiscal operations: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) posts selected central government  monthly fiscal data and quarterly debt data on its web site. However, no monthly data on fiscal  performance at the state level are available, and annual data are available only with an 8-month to  10-month lag. Consolidated information is unavailable on local government operations. In  addition, data on the functional and economic classification of expenditures are available with  considerable lag. There is also scope to improve the analytical usefulness of the presentation of the  fiscal accounts. For example, classification of government expenditure between  developmental/nondevelopmental and plan/nonplan obscures the economic nature and impact of  fiscal actions. The MoF reports central government data (on a cash basis) for publication in the  Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (latest reported data correspond to 2006).

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 11/2  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
January 5, 2011 
International Monetary Fund  700 19th Street, NW  
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA 
IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation   with India 
On December 22, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  concluded the Article IV consultation with India.1 
Background  
India’s growth is among the highest in the world. Since mid-2009 the pace of India’s recovery— led by domestic demand, especially infrastructure investment—has been strong. Monetary and  fiscal policies remain accommodative: real interest rates are low and although there has been  some fiscal consolidation, the fiscal deficit remains high. With little slack in the economy, the  ongoing exit from the policy stimulus introduced during the crisis, and structural factors affecting  food prices, inflation measures are in the 8½ to 10½ percent range. Financial conditions are  comfortable, and capital inflows have been strong.  
India’s economy is projected to grow by 8¾ percent in real terms in 2010/11, moderating to  about 8 percent the following year. Following last year’s drought, this year’s growth is already  benefiting from the rebound in agriculture and the pickup in private consumption as employment  prospects have improved and disposable incomes continue to rise. Infrastructure is expected to  remain an important growth driver and corporate investment is likely to accelerate, aided by  conducive financing conditions and robust demand growth. India’s medium-term growth  prospects remain strong. The economy is expected to continue to expand rapidly, supported by  high investment and productivity gains.  
1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with  members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial  information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On  return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the  Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the  Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the  country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:  http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.  "
